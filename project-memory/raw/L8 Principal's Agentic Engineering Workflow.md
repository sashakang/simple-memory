**0:00** · Hi everyone.

**0:01** · Welcome to this video

**0:02** · and this will be a full

**0:03** · walkthrough of my agent

**0:05** · engineering workflow.

**0:06** · My name is Kun.

**0:07** · I was previously an late

**0:09** · principal engineer,

**0:10** · worked at meta, Microsoft, and assassin

**0:13** · on many large scale systems

**0:14** · like the Bing search engine,

**0:16** · windows, and Facebook games.

**0:18** · In the recent couple of years,

**0:19** · I have been building frontier

**0:21** · coding agents at Atlassian

**0:22** · and helped many engineering teams

**0:24** · figure out how to use them effectively.

**0:27** · and I have been building heavily

**0:28** · with agents myself

**0:29** · and shipping 40 to 50

**0:32** · almost every day, sometimes more.

**0:34** · And these are all well tested

**0:36** · and shipped production.

**0:37** · not those Minecraft demos.

**0:38** · You see people wipe code on social media.

**0:40** · I have shaped my workflow

**0:42** · to be both highly

**0:43** · productive and enjoyable.

**0:45** · Many people recently asked me

**0:47** · what it looks like,

**0:48** · be honest,

**0:48** · I did debate a lot with myself

**0:51** · whether I should make this video

**0:52** · a paid course

**0:53** · because it does

**0:54** · have that level of value,

**0:56** · but ultimately

**0:57** · I decided to just share it here

**0:58** · with everyone

**0:59** · because I want to stay focused

**1:00** · on building products as my main business.

**1:03** · you can see

**1:03** · this is a bit of a long video,

**1:05** · because I'm going to walk through

**1:06** · many fundamental

**1:07** · concepts of agent engineering

**1:09** · that's not only show you how I do it,

**1:11** · but also the why

**1:13** · and how things really work

**1:14** · under the hood.

**1:15** · These are not gimmicks that look cool

**1:17** · but can't actually be used for real work.

**1:19** · These are all real workflows

**1:21** · that professionals like myself

**1:23** · use to get real work done.

**1:25** · By the end of this video,

**1:26** · I want you to feel like

**1:27** · a captain

**1:28** · that can sail a large ship

**1:30** · with a crew of agents

**1:31** · working for you,

**1:32** · and do so

**1:33** · in a stress free and satisfying way.

**1:36** · Largely speaking,

**1:37** · we will be walking

**1:37** · through these chapters.

**1:39** · We'll start with assembling our ship,

**1:42** · where I will introduce the core setup.

**1:45** · We will then talk through

**1:46** · how we recruit and ramp up

**1:48** · our crewmates

**1:49** · with the right usage of memory

**1:51** · and skills.

**1:52** · I will then demonstrate

**1:54** · how we work

**1:54** · with a single crewmate effectively.

**1:57** · Then we'll upgrade

**1:58** · to working with multiple crewmates

**2:00** · all at the same time.

**2:01** · And lastly, we will recruit a first mate

**2:04** · that manages

**2:05** · a lot of the overhead for us

**2:07** · so we can stay focused

**2:08** · on the big picture.

**2:09** · As a captain,

**2:10** · the very first level

**2:12** · is to gather our gears

**2:13** · and build our ship.

**2:14** · Now, as we get into my workflow,

**2:17** · something that's going to be really hard

**2:19** · to miss

**2:19** · is that I do

**2:20** · almost everything in my terminal.

**2:22** · I know there are a lot of people

**2:24** · who will tell you

**2:25** · that the graphical user interface

**2:26** · is better.

**2:27** · It allows richer

**2:28** · interactions and better visuals,

**2:30** · but I think by the end of this video,

**2:32** · I might just be able to convince you

**2:34** · that terminal is not quite that yet.

**2:37** · I use the terminal mostly

**2:39** · for two very real reasons.

**2:41** · One is to allow my hands to almost

**2:43** · never have to leave the keyboard.

**2:45** · This is actually a much bigger deal

**2:47** · than most people think,

**2:48** · because when your hands

**2:50** · stay on the keyboard,

**2:51** · you stay in the flow.

**2:52** · But if you have to move your hand

**2:55** · to the mouse every couple of seconds,

**2:57** · it breaks the flow and forces

**2:58** · your brain to contact switch.

**3:01** · I know there are some guy apps

**3:02** · that also have great key points

**3:04** · that allow you to do most things

**3:05** · with the keyboard as well,

**3:07** · but that's just not

**3:08** · the primary interaction

**3:09** · paradigm for guy apps,

**3:11** · And it's hard to build the discipline

**3:13** · of hands on keyboard

**3:15** · when every once in a while

**3:16** · you still have to use the mouse

**3:18** · terminal apps.

**3:19** · On the other hand,

**3:20** · are all designed for the keyboard,

**3:22** · so there is no reason for your hands

**3:24** · to move anywhere else.

**3:25** · The other

**3:26** · very important factor

**3:27** · that drives me to use

**3:28** · the terminal is that

**3:29** · I can keep the exact same workflow

**3:32** · everywhere, even on my phone.

**3:33** · but if you really don't

**3:35** · like the terminal, that's okay too.

**3:37** · I designed this video to be more

**3:38** · about the fundamental

**3:40** · concepts behind

**3:41** · agent engineering

**3:42** · rather than the mechanics.

**3:43** · So most of the things that I talk about

**3:46** · should be applicable

**3:47** · to GUI based workflows as well. Now.

**3:50** · Since we are looking at a terminal here,

**3:52** · let me share what it is

**3:53** · I'm using this

**3:55** · beautiful, clean and elegant

**3:56** · terminal emulator

**3:57** · you are looking at

**3:58** · here is called Western.

**4:01** · Western is a highly performance

**4:03** · terminal emulator built by a guy

**4:05** · named West.

**4:06** · It's got 26

**4:07** · k GitHub stars and has existed

**4:09** · for many years.

**4:10** · I like it mostly for two reasons.

**4:13** · One is that it's truly cross-platform.

**4:15** · It's pretty much

**4:16** · the only terminal emulator I can find

**4:18** · that can work on windows

**4:20** · exactly the same way

**4:21** · it works on Mac and Linux.

**4:23** · Right now

**4:23** · I mostly only work on Mac,

**4:25** · but it was a big lifesaver

**4:27** · when I was working for Microsoft

**4:28** · and was forced to use windows for work.

**4:32** · The other reason is that it's

**4:33** · highly customizable.

**4:34** · You can write Lua scripts to configure

**4:36** · pretty much everything. Here.

**4:38** · Let me show you my config in my dot

**4:40** · files.

**4:41** · It's all in this file

**4:42** · called Western dot lua.

**4:44** · It's a lower script.

**4:45** · So it's not just static values.

**4:47** · You can actually set conditions

**4:48** · and write various

**4:49** · kind of

**4:50** · logic to make your config

**4:51** · very dynamic and flexible.

**4:54** · If I change some settings

**4:55** · here, let's say

**4:56** · I change the color scheme to chalk.

**5:00** · You will see that

**5:00** · it does a hot reload instantly,

**5:02** · which is super handy.

**5:04** · But I still like my rose pine moon,

**5:06** · so let's come back to it.

**5:07** · I can't use anything else.

**5:09** · Inside of West

**5:10** · term, I run something called tmux.

**5:13** · It's short for terminal multiplexer.

**5:16** · If you haven't come across this yet,

**5:17** · it's probably easiest

**5:18** · to just show you what this does.

**5:20** · so I'm

**5:20** · typing this command here

**5:21** · to start a session.

**5:24** · Now I'm inside of t max.

**5:26** · You can see

**5:26** · not much is different except for that.

**5:29** · There is a bar at the top

**5:30** · showing some information,

**5:32** · and I still get a shell

**5:34** · where I can type commands,

**5:35** · But now I can split my terminal

**5:37** · into multiple panes,

**5:39** · as many of them as I like.

**5:41** · This is super useful

**5:42** · because I can spin up an agent

**5:44** · in one pain and spin up

**5:46** · an editor in another,

**5:47** · and still have a pain to myself

**5:50** · so I can just run commands.

**5:52** · I can also spin up

**5:53** · multiple tabs

**5:54** · and they are also called windows in.

**5:57** · This is very useful

**5:58** · for running multiple

**5:59** · agent sessions in parallel.

**6:01** · The other cool thing is

**6:02** · that tmux

**6:03** · sessions are persistent in the server.

**6:06** · So if I use a keyboard shortcut here

**6:08** · to detach from tmux, you can see

**6:11** · I'm back in the normal shell

**6:12** · without the status bar at the top.

**6:14** · But if I type the same command to launch

**6:17** · tmux again,

**6:19** · I get back to the exact same state

**6:21** · I was in So I can continue my work here.

**6:24** · What's even more useful

**6:25** · is that I can connect

**6:26** · to this same session

**6:27** · from another device,

**6:28** · like my laptop or my phone.

**6:30** · that's a real game changer.

**6:32** · That's very hard to replicate

**6:34** · without this terminal centric workflow.

**6:36** · If you just install tmux by default,

**6:39** · it doesn't have the same experience

**6:40** · while showing here,

**6:42** · like the tab bar and the metadata.

**6:44** · You will probably need to

**6:45** · do a bit of configuration

**6:46** · and customize it.

**6:48** · Let me show you my team config.

**6:52** · Here it is.

**6:53** · Most of these settings are key points

**6:55** · that I have been using

**6:56** · for many years,

**6:57** · and built into my muscle memory.

**7:00** · Some of these are for styling and various

**7:02** · kind of behaviors.

**7:03** · There are many

**7:04** · YouTube videos

**7:05** · that go into more details

**7:06** · about tmux configuration.

**7:08** · So I'm not going to go down the rabbit

**7:09** · hole here. For now.

**7:11** · You just need to know

**7:12** · that you are likely

**7:13** · want to spend some time

**7:15** · configuring your t mux for it.

**7:17** · Look good and work

**7:18** · well for This text editor here is Nuvem.

**7:21** · It's basically the modern version of vim.

**7:23** · It's my favorite text editor.

**7:25** · If you are not familiar with vim yet,

**7:27** · it's an editor

**7:28** · whose main purpose

**7:29** · is to keep your hands on the keyboard.

**7:31** · So if you watch my keystrokes here,

**7:34** · I can move the cursor

**7:35** · up and down, left and right with keys.

**7:38** · I can also scroll up or scroll down.

**7:42** · If I have to make edits,

**7:43** · I can go into insert

**7:44** · mode and start to type anything I like.

**7:48** · There are a ton of keyboard shortcuts

**7:50** · for doing everything you need.

**7:51** · For example,

**7:52** · let's say

**7:52** · I want to delete the current line.

**7:54** · I can just type dd and it's gone.

**7:56** · I can undo it by typing you.

**7:59** · And if you look at the left hand side

**8:01** · I have relative line numbers.

**8:03** · This line number 238

**8:06** · is the current line number.

**8:07** · And the line above

**8:09** · shows one,

**8:09** · which means it's one line

**8:11** · above the current line

**8:12** · and the lines below as well.

**8:14** · So let's say

**8:15** · I want to jump to the line

**8:16** · that says set environment.

**8:19** · That's 11 lines above the current line.

**8:21** · So I can just type 11 k.

**8:23** · And I'm here.

**8:24** · So once you have enough muscle memory,

**8:27** · you can just navigate around

**8:28** · much more quickly than using a mouse.

**8:31** · I also have a bunch of plugins

**8:32** · that help me get around in as well.

**8:35** · And I have key points for all of them.

**8:38** · Like space S

**8:39** · allows me to search

**8:40** · or grep for the code base,

**8:41** · so I can just type rows

**8:43** · and it will find all the occurrences

**8:45** · of rows in the current code base.

**8:48** · I can type space F

**8:50** · to find files by their names,

**8:51** · like if I type flake

**8:53** · I'll get to the flake file immediately.

**8:56** · Working with them

**8:57** · has a learning curve for sure.

**8:59** · But once you get used to it,

**9:00** · it just feels really, really good.

**9:03** · Whenever I'm

**9:03** · in, I'm just flying like a bird

**9:06** · and it's awesome okay?

**9:07** · I have to stop here before

**9:08** · this turns into a vim tutorial.

**9:10** · You can find a lot of great

**9:12** · YouTube videos

**9:12** · that will help

**9:13** · you get started on them

**9:14** · and become a master.

**9:16** · Maybe one last tip for me

**9:18** · is just how to exit.

**9:20** · Here you go.

**9:21** · All right.

**9:22** · Our ship is ready to sail,

**9:23** · but we have no crewmates yet.

**9:25** · Where? The captain.

**9:27** · We can't do everything by ourselves.

**9:28** · We need to bring in agents

**9:30** · as our crewmates.

**9:31** · I use four different

**9:32** · agent harnesses regularly.

**9:34** · There is cloud,

**9:35** · which is cloud code,

**9:37** · which is basically

**9:37** · the only practical choice

**9:39** · if you are using the subscription

**9:40** · from anthropic.

**9:42** · Generally speaking, though,

**9:43** · it's a pretty good harness.

**9:45** · I think

**9:45** · it has the most sensible

**9:47** · default experience out of the box.

**9:49** · It's also got a pretty rich feature set.

**9:51** · The downside

**9:52** · is that sometimes it's a little

**9:54** · bit buggy,

**9:54** · and it's not as customizable

**9:57** · as some of the other options.

**9:58** · The next one I use a lot is Codex COI.

**10:02** · It's written in rust,

**10:03** · and you can feel

**10:04** · it's a little bit smoother

**10:05** · than cloud code when you use it.

**10:07** · It's also open source,

**10:09** · so if you run into some problems,

**10:10** · You can often

**10:11** · just have Codex

**10:12** · inspect its own source code

**10:14** · and figure out a workaround by itself.

**10:17** · It's a bit

**10:17** · lacking in terms of bells and whistles,

**10:19** · and it's also not very customizable.

**10:22** · And then there is the Pi coding agent.

**10:25** · And this whole philosophy

**10:27** · is to be minimal and highly extensible.

**10:29** · It's great

**10:30** · if you don't want any bloat

**10:31** · and you'd like to tinker around

**10:33** · and kind of make it your own.

**10:35** · and lastly, there is open code.

**10:38** · I like it a lot.

**10:40** · It's got a battery smooth t UI,

**10:42** · And it's got

**10:43** · good integration

**10:44** · with pretty much

**10:45** · every model you can find.

**10:46** · It's also got a more complete

**10:48** · out of the box feature set than Pi.

**10:50** · So if you want to use an agent harness

**10:52** · that is model agnostic

**10:54** · and one that you can just grab

**10:56** · from the shelf and just go.

**10:57** · Open code is a pretty good choice.

**10:59** · For the rest of this video though.

**11:01** · I'm going to use cloud code

**11:02** · because I know

**11:03** · many people are already familiar with it,

**11:05** · but I have been very strict

**11:07** · about making my workflow

**11:08** · agent agnostic

**11:09** · because the landscape is changing very,

**11:11** · very fast.

**11:12** · who knows which model or agents

**11:14** · will be the best

**11:15** · performing one next month?

**11:16** · Right.

**11:16** · So everything I show here in

**11:18** · the video is agent agnostic

**11:20** · and should be applicable

**11:21** · regardless of which model or harness

**11:23** · you use.

**11:25** · The problem with this crewmates

**11:27** · is that they are fresh recruits,

**11:28** · and they have no idea how we run our ship

**11:30** · or how we like to work.

**11:32** · We need a proper onboarding process

**11:34** · to ramp them up.

**11:35** · We will do this mostly through

**11:37** · two ways memory files and skills.

**11:40** · There are few types of memory

**11:41** · files, global memory

**11:43** · files, and project level memory files.

**11:45** · The global memory

**11:46** · file for cloud code is at this location,

**11:51** · and every other

**11:52** · agent

**11:53** · uses the other standard location here.

**11:56** · So what I do is that I use this command

**11:59** · Which made MD a symbolic link to MD.

**12:04** · So they both exist,

**12:05** · but under the hood

**12:06** · they point to the same file.

**12:08** · Here's

**12:08** · the content of my actual global memory

**12:11** · file. You can see it's pretty minimal.

**12:14** · There is only 27 lines.

**12:16** · Because everything in this file

**12:17** · gets loaded into the system

**12:19** · prompt of every single agent session

**12:21** · across all our projects.

**12:23** · If we have too much content in this file,

**12:26** · it will silently use a lot of our tokens.

**12:29** · I mostly write down

**12:30** · my personal preferences here,

**12:31** · like never use em.

**12:34** · Somehow AI models are trained

**12:36** · to use

**12:36** · em by default instead of a plain dash.

**12:39** · So now whenever I see em,

**12:41** · I just feel like it's robotic.

**12:43** · And I don't like that

**12:44** · when I need the agent

**12:45** · to write something for me.

**12:46** · Like PR descriptions.

**12:48** · Oh, and this is a good one.

**12:49** · When making technical decisions,

**12:51** · don't give too much weight

**12:52** · to development cost.

**12:54** · Here is something interesting

**12:55** · that you may not know. Let me show you.

**12:58** · If we ask a frontier model

**13:00** · to estimate the development

**13:01** · cost of a project,

**13:03** · let's say

**13:04** · I want to build a 3D

**13:06** · first person shooting game

**13:08** · that I can play locally with AI enemies.

**13:12** · How long do you think that will take?

**13:16** · Let's see what cloud will say.

**13:18** · Okay, here it is.

**13:19** · See, the estimate is in days

**13:21** · and weeks and months.

**13:23** · But if we ask the agents to

**13:25** · actually build it now,

**13:26** · I can guarantee

**13:27** · it will come back with a playable version

**13:29** · in just a few minutes.

**13:31** · Because I have done this so many times.

**13:33** · This mismatch is happening

**13:35** · because the models

**13:36** · were trained from human data,

**13:38** · and that is what

**13:39** · a typical human developer

**13:40** · would give as the estimate.

**13:43** · AI doesn't seem to know it

**13:44** · can code much faster than humans yet.

**13:47** · When AI is making technical decisions,

**13:50** · it's implicitly

**13:51** · assuming the development cost

**13:52** · for some of the options are much higher

**13:55** · than they actually are.

**13:56** · This biases the model to choose

**13:59** · cheap solutions

**14:00** · that are often low quality,

**14:02** · not scalable, or hard to maintain.

**14:04** · So I have this rule here to

**14:06** · correct that bias.

**14:09** · I also said when

**14:10** · doing bug fixes

**14:12** · always starts

**14:13** · with reproducing the bug

**14:14** · in an end to end setting

**14:16** · as closely aligned

**14:17** · with how an end user

**14:19** · would experience it as possible.

**14:21** · AI models today by default

**14:23** · like to write unit tests,

**14:25** · which are often not sufficient

**14:26** · and not really covering

**14:28** · the product behaviors we want to guard.

**14:30** · I found that leaning into end to end

**14:32** · testing is a lot more reliable.

**14:34** · Besides these preferences,

**14:35** · I also have

**14:36** · some interesting stuff opinions,

**14:39** · which is super useful.

**14:41** · That's a slightly different

**14:42** · topic though,

**14:42** · so I won't go into too much detail here,

**14:44** · but I do have a blog post

**14:46** · explaining how that works,

**14:47** · which I'll link here

**14:48** · in case you're interested.

**14:49** · Besides the global memory

**14:51** · file, each project

**14:52** · can also have a project level memory

**14:54** · file.

**14:54** · Let me show you

**14:55** · one example here by going into

**14:57** · this project called High Bit.

**14:59** · This is an AI Twitter app

**15:00** · I have been working on.

**15:01** · The project level memory file

**15:03** · is typically stored as cloud or agents,

**15:07** · depending on which agent you use.

**15:09** · I do the same thing here

**15:10** · with a symbolic link.

**15:11** · So the same file is shared

**15:13** · for both cloud and other agents.

**15:15** · This one we are looking at

**15:16** · here is a little bit verbose.

**15:18** · I would say

**15:19** · I will probably clean this up after this,

**15:21** · but let me show you on a high level

**15:23** · what I put into this file.

**15:24** · It has some context on what

**15:26** · this project is,

**15:27** · how the repo is laid out,

**15:30** · some terminology,

**15:32** · how some of the most important

**15:34** · components work,

**15:35** · and how to do end to end testing,

**15:37** · and some conventions at the bottom.

**15:40** · This file is a lot more verbose

**15:42** · than the global memory file,

**15:44** · because this is basically the collective

**15:46** · learning of all the agent sessions

**15:48** · in this project.

**15:49** · The way I built

**15:49** · this file is not by writing

**15:51** · everything by hand,

**15:52** · but rather that every time

**15:54** · I saw the agent doing something wrong,

**15:56** · I would correct it

**15:57** · and ask it to remember

**15:58** · to not make the same mistake again

**16:00** · by storing the learning

**16:01** · into this memory file.

**16:03** · So over time,

**16:04** · our crewmates working on this project

**16:06** · get smarter and more experienced.

**16:08** · You don't need any fancy memory system

**16:10** · to do that.

**16:10** · This markdown file is all

**16:12** · it takes over time.

**16:13** · It does tend to get more

**16:15** · and more bloated though.

**16:16** · One way

**16:17** · I reduce the size of this file

**16:19** · is by moving

**16:20** · some conditional information

**16:21** · that is not always needed into a skill.

**16:24** · For example,

**16:25** · the end to end

**16:26** · testing instruction here is only needed

**16:29** · if the agent is making changes, right?

**16:31** · So if I just ask the agent a question,

**16:34** · this whole section is totally useless

**16:36** · and would be wasting tokens.

**16:38** · The way to improve efficiency

**16:40** · here is by converting

**16:42** · this kind of

**16:43** · conditionally useful information

**16:44** · from the memory file into skills.

**16:47** · I typically just

**16:48** · ask the agent to do this.

**16:49** · Here, let me do it alive.

**16:52** · I will say let's extract the end to end

**16:56** · testing instructions

**16:58** · junctions in our agents

**17:01** · and file into a project level skill.

**17:07** · Cloud already knew how

**17:09** · to do this,

**17:10** · what skills mean and how to create them,

**17:12** · but other agent

**17:13** · harnesses may not understand

**17:15** · how to do that out of the box.

**17:17** · To teach your agent how to create skills,

**17:20** · you can install a skill called

**17:22** · Skill Creator which

**17:24** · which was written by anthropic.

**17:26** · You can do that by running this command.

**17:28** · This NPC's skills thing

**17:31** · is a call from Vercel that is very handy.

**17:34** · It's basically my main tool

**17:36** · for installing and managing skills.

**17:38** · It supports pretty much any agent.

**17:41** · Once this skill is installed,

**17:42** · your agent will be able

**17:43** · to follow the rules and create

**17:45** · new skills for you moving forward.

**17:48** · cloud has done its work.

**17:49** · Let's look at what cloud created for us.

**17:53** · It basically removed

**17:56** · a large chunk of the content

**17:58** · from our agents MD file and move

**18:02** · that into this this skill file.

**18:05** · This is a good thing about skills

**18:07** · is that it's designed

**18:08** · for progressive disclosure,

**18:10** · which means when your agent starts,

**18:12** · it only loads this tiny description

**18:14** · field from your skills into the system

**18:16** · prompt to know what these skills do,

**18:18** · and only when it actually decides

**18:21** · that it needs to use a certain skill.

**18:23** · It will then reads the rest of this file.

**18:25** · This allows you to store

**18:27** · a lot of the knowledge

**18:28** · about how to do various

**18:29** · kinds of things

**18:30** · without blowing up your system.

**18:32** · Prompt and memory file

**18:33** · with a ton of contents

**18:34** · that uses your tokens

**18:35** · for every single request,

**18:37** · whether the request actually

**18:38** · needs those skills or not.

**18:40** · One thing

**18:40** · I do want you to know about skills

**18:42** · is that you should generally avoid

**18:45** · installing random skills

**18:46** · from the internet.

**18:47** · Even the ones that have a lot of

**18:49** · GitHub stars.

**18:50** · First of all,

**18:51** · these skills

**18:52** · can instruct your agents to run

**18:53** · pretty much anything on your machine.

**18:56** · This is a very risky thing to do,

**18:57** · because the agent can lick your API keys

**19:00** · or even credentials to your bank

**19:02** · account to untrusted

**19:03** · third parties without you knowing.

**19:06** · even if we put aside

**19:07** · the security problem,

**19:08** · some of the skills

**19:09** · actually degrade your agents performance.

**19:12** · Look at this repo

**19:13** · here called Android Skills, which has

**19:16** · 177,000 GitHub stars.

**19:20** · That's like massive.

**19:21** · So it must be really good, right?

**19:23** · I actually evaluated a skill in this repo

**19:26** · with Program Bench,

**19:28** · which tests

**19:29** · the agent's ability to build

**19:30** · programs end to end.

**19:32** · And the result shows

**19:34** · that by using this skill,

**19:36** · the agent will use

**19:37** · 5% more tokens

**19:38** · while making the results worse.

**19:40** · And if you look closely, this skill is

**19:44** · not even written by André

**19:45** · Karpathy himself.

**19:47** · I'm not here to criticize

**19:48** · the author of this repo, though.

**19:50** · I'm mainly saying

**19:51** · that being popular

**19:52** · is not the same as actually being good.

**19:55** · A lot of the skills

**19:56** · being widely shared today

**19:58** · have not been rigorously evaluated,

**20:00** · and are typically just some random guy

**20:03** · who found something

**20:04** · that worked for themselves and

**20:06** · and somehow got it to go viral.

**20:08** · Their GitHub stars

**20:10** · only tell you how popular they are

**20:11** · and not

**20:12** · whether they are actually helpful.

**20:14** · So as a general rule of thumb,

**20:16** · I recommend that you do not install

**20:18** · any skill

**20:19** · from the internet

**20:20** · that claims to magically

**20:22** · make your agent perform better,

**20:23** · but hasn't published anything

**20:25** · rigorous that proves its claim.

**20:27** · All right.

**20:28** · Now that we have memory files

**20:30** · and skills to help ramp up

**20:31** · crewmates, it's

**20:32** · finally time

**20:33** · to actually start working

**20:34** · with the crewmates and set sail.

**20:36** · The first thing about working with

**20:38** · the crewmate is how you talk to them.

**20:40** · I have pretty much completely moved

**20:42** · to voice input now, So.

**20:44** · Instead of typing,

**20:45** · I will just say, explain this

**20:47** · repo in a concise way

**20:48** · and give me a recap of what

**20:50** · the recent press have been working on.

**20:53** · This is just so easy.

**20:54** · There is an actual paper from Stanford

**20:57** · that seriously compared the efficiency.

**20:59** · And basically

**21:01** · talking is three times

**21:02** · faster than typing.

**21:04** · So this is a very big boost

**21:05** · in productivity.

**21:07** · I also want to show you something

**21:08** · interesting here.

**21:09** · If we go to the references of this paper

**21:13** · look who's here.

**21:15** · It's our guy Dario.

**21:17** · What is the CEO of anthropic doing here?

**21:20** · Apparently if we follow this link

**21:23** · Dario was doing some speech recognition

**21:26** · stuff back in 2016.

**21:28** · Now we're using speech recognition

**21:29** · technology to talk to cloud

**21:31** · which is also created by Dario.

**21:33** · What a small world.

**21:35** · The voice input.

**21:36** · We just did

**21:37** · was actually transcribed

**21:38** · locally using this app called Open

**21:41** · Super Whisper.

**21:43** · It's completely free and open source,

**21:45** · which is what I think

**21:46** · this type of software should be.

**21:47** · It runs the whisper model

**21:49** · locally on your machine

**21:50** · and do the transcription.

**21:51** · And the quality is like

**21:53** · really, really good.

**21:54** · So this is how I do most of my prompts.

**21:56** · Now, the only case

**21:58** · where I fall back to typing

**22:00** · is when I need to give the agent a URL

**22:03** · or a file path, or something like that.

**22:05** · Trust me,

**22:06** · you don't want to speak a URL out loud,

**22:09** · whether it's by yourself or

**22:10** · with other humans around.

**22:13** · If we

**22:13** · come back to this prompt

**22:15** · and let the agent run,

**22:16** · you will see that

**22:17** · because we asked the agent

**22:19** · to look at recent polls,

**22:20** · it will need to call GitHub

**22:22** · to fetch the data.

**22:24** · This is an important thing

**22:25** · to pay attention to,

**22:26** · because agents

**22:27** · rely on external tools

**22:29** · like GitHub to do its tasks.

**22:31** · The design of these external tools

**22:33** · can greatly affect

**22:34** · your agents performance.

**22:35** · Take GitHub as an example.

**22:37** · Many people use the GitHub MCP

**22:39** · server for accessing GitHub.

**22:41** · However, I ran this benchmark here

**22:44** · that measured various

**22:45** · kinds of ways

**22:46** · to access GitHub For the exact same tasks

**22:50** · using GitHub, MCP

**22:51** · server will cost you to spend three times

**22:54** · more on token cost,

**22:56** · and more than double

**22:57** · the latency compared to using the CLI.

**23:00** · If you are using the GitHub MCP,

**23:01** · you are pretty much wasting

**23:03** · both time and money

**23:04** · for no clear benefits.

**23:06** · Now you can see there's

**23:07** · this thing called axi,

**23:09** · which has the lowest cost

**23:10** · but highest success rate.

**23:12** · So what is it? Let me show you.

**23:16** · Axi is a set of

**23:18** · design standards

**23:19** · I authored

**23:19** · after discovering the huge upside

**23:21** · we can have by designing our tools

**23:24** · to treat agents as a first class citizen

**23:27** · and optimize for agent ergonomics.

**23:30** · I created ten principles

**23:32** · for how to make a tool

**23:33** · highly efficient for agents.

**23:35** · For example,

**23:37** · using token efficient output

**23:38** · format can save about 40%

**23:40** · tokens compared to using JSON.

**23:42** · And then I built a few axes with

**23:45** · Besides the GitHub axis I showed earlier,

**23:47** · I also built Chrome dev tools actually,

**23:49** · and benchmarked

**23:51** · it against other various browser tools.

**23:54** · And Here you can see

**23:56** · the agents taking less turns

**23:58** · and using less tokens

**23:59** · to get the same tasks done with the ax.

**24:02** · The main point here

**24:03** · is when you give tools to your agents,

**24:05** · do some research on their efficiency

**24:07** · because they can greatly affect

**24:09** · how much mileage

**24:10** · you get out of your agents.

**24:12** · If you want to use the axes

**24:14** · I mentioned earlier,

**24:15** · you can just go to this site called axis

**24:18** · and find them in this catalog.

**24:20** · You can just go to the repo

**24:22** · and find instructions

**24:23** · for how to start using them.

**24:25** · Speaking of this catalog,

**24:27** · there is something called

**24:28** · lavish axi here.

**24:30** · This is a very important tool

**24:32** · in my setup.

**24:33** · I pretty much rely on this tool

**24:35** · for planning any kind of complex work.

**24:37** · Let's do a real feature live

**24:39** · and I'll show you how it works.

**24:40** · Let me first launch high bit

**24:42** · to show you

**24:43** · what I'm trying to work on here.

**24:45** · Hybrid is an AI Twitter

**24:46** · I'm building for kids.

**24:48** · I'll just create a test profile here.

**24:53** · You can see here

**24:54** · at the top I

**24:55** · have these two buttons,

**24:56** · what I can do and my progress.

**24:59** · They are showing very similar content

**25:01** · right now which is a problem.

**25:03** · So and also the UI is not very exciting

**25:07** · or fun.

**25:08** · So let me go back and talk to cloud.

**25:14** · I'll still use voice input here.

**25:16** · I'll just say

**25:18** · I'd like to consolidate

**25:19** · the what I can do

**25:21** · and my progress buttons,

**25:23** · because their functionality

**25:25** · is very similar

**25:25** · and I'd like to revamp the experience

**25:28** · there to be something

**25:29** · more fun

**25:30** · and exciting,

**25:31** · like in an achievement system.

**25:33** · Come up with some options

**25:35** · and let's discuss.

**25:36** · Don't use lavish.

**25:39** · Okay, the reason I said don't use

**25:41** · lavish is that I wanted to show you

**25:44** · what's the default workflow today.

**25:45** · Looks like for many people.

**25:47** · And then I'm going to show you

**25:48** · the difference lavish makes.

**25:50** · Because I already have leverage

**25:52** · skills installed.

**25:53** · My cloud will automatically use lavish

**25:55** · for this type of question,

**25:56** · which is why I had to tell

**25:58** · it not to do that right now.

**26:00** · Okay, cloud is doing this work.

**26:02** · Now. Cloud has come back with a response.

**26:05** · Sometimes it will use its plan mode,

**26:07** · or sometimes I will ask you

**26:09** · to write down the plan

**26:09** · in the markdown file,

**26:10** · but it's more or less the same.

**26:13** · It's a wall of text

**26:14** · I now have to read through.

**26:15** · It's not very easy to understand

**26:17** · what what

**26:18** · each option

**26:20** · is actually going to look like,

**26:22** · and if I'm not happy

**26:23** · with some parts of it,

**26:24** · I can't very easily tell cloud

**26:27** · which parts I'm talking about.

**26:28** · I can select a piece of text

**26:30** · in the plan and say, this is wrong.

**26:32** · Now let's try

**26:33** · the exact same prompt with lavish.

**26:35** · Here it goes again.

**26:36** · I actually don't have to say

**26:37** · use lavish

**26:38** · because the agent already

**26:40** · has the lavish skill

**26:41** · that tells the agent

**26:42** · for this type of planning

**26:44** · it should establish, for demo purpose,

**26:46** · I just wanted to be explicit.

**26:48** · Cloud would roughly do the same things

**26:50** · to figure out the options,

**26:52** · except at the end

**26:53** · it would not print out that wall of text.

**26:56** · Again,

**26:56** · it will launch the browser

**26:58** · and show me this page. Now look at this.

**27:01** · This is the lavish editor.

**27:03** · The reason I named it lavish

**27:04** · is that it's richer than a rich editor.

**27:07** · I almost named it filthy

**27:09** · rich editor,

**27:09** · but that's just not the best

**27:11** · sounding name.

**27:12** · Lavish editor basically

**27:14** · instructed the agent

**27:15** · to create an HTML artifact

**27:17** · to visualize what we need to discuss.

**27:19** · It always uses the same design system

**27:22** · as the current project being worked on,

**27:24** · so this is consistent

**27:25** · with how the app actually looks.

**27:28** · This makes it very easy

**27:29** · to reveal concepts and prototypes.

**27:32** · See the option is laid out here.

**27:33** · This is so much easier to understand

**27:36** · than the huge wall of text

**27:37** · we were looking at

**27:38** · in the terminal, right?

**27:40** · I can also annotate

**27:41** · and make comments

**27:43** · on specific parts of the artifacts

**27:45** · to give feedback to the agent.

**27:47** · This is something

**27:47** · that's really hard

**27:48** · to do with the wall of

**27:49** · text, or a markdown file

**27:52** · And at the bottom, there

**27:54** · are things for me to decide on,

**27:56** · and I can just click on these options

**27:59** · to make the decisions.

**28:00** · I just sent this feedback back

**28:02** · to the agents inside of lavish

**28:04** · without even having to go back

**28:05** · to the terminal.

**28:06** · Honestly, I can never go back

**28:08** · to reading text in the terminal anymore.

**28:10** · This is just way too much more efficient.

**28:12** · Now the agent has made updates to the and

**28:15** · I feel happy about this,

**28:16** · so I'll just tell the agent

**28:18** · to start building.

**28:19** · Start building and we'll end

**28:22** · the session.

**28:23** · We can

**28:24** · then go back to the terminal now and see.

**28:27** · The agent will start to work

**28:28** · on the implementation,

**28:30** · because we already clarified

**28:31** · all the requirements

**28:32** · in the planning phase.

**28:33** · I typically don't

**28:34** · need to interfere at all

**28:35** · during this implementation phase.

**28:37** · I only come back to this

**28:38** · when the agent has done.

**28:39** · And when the agent says it's done,

**28:42** · that's actually

**28:42** · when things get really tricky.

**28:45** · This is where a lot of people

**28:46** · will spin up

**28:47** · their editor

**28:48** · and start reviewing the diff.

**28:51** · The problem is, AI writes code so fast,

**28:54** · and if every piece of code requires

**28:57** · your review,

**28:57** · then you are creating a big

**28:59** · bottleneck on yourself

**29:00** · because you can only review so many

**29:02** · every day.

**29:03** · Your velocity will be hard capped by it.

**29:06** · And even more importantly, reviewing diff

**29:09** · is just not fun.

**29:11** · No one says I became an engineer

**29:13** · because I love reviewing diffs all day.

**29:15** · My advice

**29:16** · here is that

**29:18** · in order to

**29:18** · really scale ourselves with AI,

**29:21** · we have to think of ourselves

**29:22** · more as an engineering manager

**29:24** · or engineering director.

**29:26** · Your directors

**29:27** · most likely don't review any place yet.

**29:30** · They can influence the quality

**29:31** · of their team's software

**29:32** · by creating good culture

**29:34** · and processes, and rely on the team

**29:37** · to carry them out.

**29:38** · That's what we should do with AI.

**29:40** · What I do here,

**29:41** · when the agent says the work is

**29:43** · done, is not to start

**29:44** · reviewing the dips or start

**29:46** · manually testing the changes.

**29:48** · That's too much overhead.

**29:49** · On myself,

**29:50** · I sense the change into a pipeline

**29:52** · I built called No Mistakes.

**29:57** · No mistakes is also free and open source.

**30:00** · It orchestrates your agent

**30:01** · to execute a series of steps

**30:03** · that takes this first pass code

**30:05** · all the way through to a clean PR.

**30:07** · It would first create a branch

**30:09** · if one doesn't exist yet,

**30:10** · and then create a commit

**30:12** · and then take it through a pipeline

**30:14** · in an isolated work tree,

**30:16** · so nothing during the validation

**30:18** · would affect your current repo.

**30:19** · It would first understand

**30:20** · your real intent behind the change

**30:22** · by analyzing

**30:23** · your agent session,

**30:24** · then rebase the change

**30:26** · on top of the latest main branch

**30:28** · on remote

**30:28** · origin and resolve merge

**30:30** · conflicts up front,

**30:31** · then starts

**30:32** · an adversarial review

**30:34** · in its own fresh context window.

**30:36** · This is where most problems get caught,

**30:38** · and obvious problems

**30:40** · will get self corrected,

**30:41** · but ambiguous ones

**30:43** · that have product

**30:44** · implications will be escalated

**30:46** · to us humans for a decision after review.

**30:49** · It also tries to test

**30:51** · the change end to end

**30:52** · against the original intent,

**30:53** · and this step will

**30:55** · actually record evidence that proves

**30:57** · the change is working that we can.

**30:58** · Then later on

**30:59** · look at to gain more confidence.

**31:02** · It will then do a documentation pass

**31:04** · of updating all relevant documentation

**31:06** · to reflect the latest change.

**31:08** · And also finally,

**31:09** · make sure there is no linting problems

**31:11** · before pushing the branch

**31:13** · to remote and raise a PR.

**31:15** · The no mistakes

**31:16** · pipeline will also keep babysitting

**31:18** · the PR

**31:19** · until it's merged,

**31:20** · because during the PR phase,

**31:22** · we can still have merge conflicts

**31:23** · that come in, or CI pipeline failures

**31:26** · that are very annoying as well,

**31:28** · with no mistakes doing the babysitting.

**31:30** · We don't have to waste our own time

**31:31** · at all.

**31:32** · Another way to trigger

**31:33** · no mistakes is as a skill.

**31:36** · I can just type no mistakes in the agent

**31:39** · and it will do the same pipeline

**31:41** · as This may seem very slow,

**31:43** · but in practice

**31:44** · I never stare at this screen.

**31:46** · I would go spin up other tasks.

**31:47** · I come back only when no mistake says

**31:50** · all checks passed

**31:51** · that's when I go to the PR

**31:53** · and apply my judgment.

**31:54** · Here's the PR

**31:55** · from the change we just did.

**31:57** · We can see here

**31:58** · it summarized the original intent.

**32:00** · What's changed,

**32:02** · how it's tested,

**32:03** · and what happened

**32:04** · during the normal stakes pipeline.

**32:06** · We can click to see the evidence

**32:09** · from its testing

**32:10** · to know

**32:11** · whether it's really done

**32:12** · what we asked for,

**32:14** · depending on what the change is,

**32:16** · the evidence

**32:17** · could be a screenshot like this

**32:19** · a video demo,

**32:20** · a log file, or something else.

**32:22** · It's designed

**32:22** · to give you the most direct way

**32:24** · to see the change

**32:25** · working as you intended.

**32:26** · We can also see that

**32:27** · the pipeline discovers

**32:29** · some problems

**32:29** · and fix them before raising the PR.

**32:32** · This is a good time to audit

**32:34** · whether these changes

**32:35** · are actually what we need.

**32:36** · If anything doesn't look right,

**32:38** · we can go back to the agent

**32:39** · and ask for more changes

**32:40** · before merging this PR.

**32:42** · This risk assessment

**32:43** · here is also very useful.

**32:45** · I basically look at this to decide

**32:47** · how much time

**32:47** · I should spend on reviewing

**32:49** · this change in more detail.

**32:51** · For low risk changes,

**32:52** · I don't really look at the diff at all

**32:54** · Because I have validated

**32:56** · time and time again for low risk changes.

**32:58** · Any problem I could catch

**33:00** · is very likely

**33:01** · already caught by the pipeline

**33:03** · only more

**33:03** · risky changes are worth my

**33:05** · This is how I scale up

**33:06** · the volume of code changes

**33:07** · I do every day through

**33:09** · a large crew of agents,

**33:10** · without losing control on quality.

**33:12** · One thing we are starting to see

**33:14** · now is that the place where I spend

**33:16** · time is towards the beginning

**33:18** · and the end of the task.

**33:20** · At the beginning

**33:21** · I would spend time in lavish to plan

**33:23** · the requirements more clearly.

**33:25** · At the end

**33:26** · I would come in and hold

**33:27** · a bar on quality.

**33:29** · All these parts in the middle

**33:31** · is done by AI,

**33:32** · which frees me up to spin up other tasks.

**33:35** · This is a core aspect of how I work,

**33:37** · and you can see the more time

**33:39** · I can free up in the middle,

**33:41** · the more work I can go do in parallel.

**33:43** · So an interesting question

**33:45** · now is

**33:46** · how do we get the agents

**33:47** · to work for longer

**33:48** · and longer in the middle?

**33:50** · That depends on us

**33:51** · giving them more and more complex tasks

**33:53** · that take longer to complete.

**33:55** · But more complex tasks are often

**33:58** · not as easy for our agents

**33:59** · to complete autonomously.

**34:02** · An extreme version of this is

**34:03** · when I go to bed,

**34:04** · I sleep for 7 to 8 hours every night.

**34:07** · How do I keep the agents busy

**34:09** · for eight hours?

**34:10** · This is where I say good night.

**34:13** · Have fun.

**34:13** · It's another free and open source tool

**34:15** · I built specifically

**34:17** · for long running tasks.

**34:18** · It's becoming quite popular.

**34:20** · It's that simple to use.

**34:22** · Just give it an objective

**34:23** · and it will keep going

**34:24** · until it meets some stop condition

**34:26** · you defined.

**34:27** · Let me show you a real example

**34:29** · that I often do.

**34:30** · This is again in the hybrid repo

**34:32** · I will run.

**34:33** · Good night.

**34:33** · Have fun and give a prompt.

**34:36** · Pretend you are a seven year

**34:38** · old kid and use the high bit

**34:40** · app end to end.

**34:41** · Don't mind

**34:42** · the profile

**34:42** · creation step

**34:43** · which is designed for parents

**34:45** · in the rest of the app.

**34:46** · Try to do different things

**34:47** · and find the first usability problem

**34:50** · that will confuse you as a kid,

**34:52** · or stop you from knowing how to proceed.

**34:54** · If you find a problem, stop and fix it,

**34:57** · then rinse and repeat.

**35:00** · Here he goes.

**35:01** · Good night. Have fun.

**35:02** · Is now running in the loop.

**35:03** · To execute on what I just asked for.

**35:06** · I can monitor token usage here

**35:08** · or how many iterations have been done.

**35:10** · The iterations will be showing up

**35:12** · as the moons in this row,

**35:13** · and I can see how many commits

**35:15** · have been made as well.

**35:16** · Or I can just go to bed

**35:17** · knowing the agents won't stop

**35:19** · until there is no more problem

**35:20** · to be found.

**35:21** · When I wake up,

**35:22** · I can reveal a list of commits

**35:24** · made on this new branch and decide

**35:26** · which ones I want.

**35:28** · I typically use goodnight.

**35:29** · Have fun for improving

**35:31** · on some verifiable objectives

**35:33** · or objectives,

**35:34** · where I trust the agent

**35:36** · to have the reasonable judgment over,

**35:38** · like the one we just did.

**35:39** · Verifiable objectives

**35:41** · are more like reducing page load

**35:43** · time, improving

**35:44** · end to end test coverage

**35:45** · or like Android hypothesis auto research.

**35:48** · Keep experimenting different hypotheses

**35:51** · to improve on the metric.

**35:52** · These are all

**35:53** · well suited for a long running loop.

**35:55** · To tackle

**35:56** · the recently introduced

**35:57** · slash goal

**35:58** · command in Codex and Cloud

**36:00** · code can also do something similar,

**36:02** · good night.

**36:03** · Have fun

**36:03** · still gives me a better experience.

**36:05** · Because I can set a token cap or

**36:08** · iteration cap or stop condition

**36:10** · more precisely,

**36:12** · whereas in Cloud Code and Codex,

**36:14** · if I set a goal before I go to bed,

**36:16** · I might wake up realizing my weekly

**36:19** · quota is all Good night.

**36:20** · Have fun.

**36:21** · Solved a very important problem,

**36:23** · which is to keep the agents

**36:24** · running for a long time.

**36:26** · So when the agents are running,

**36:28** · I'm freed up to do more things.

**36:30** · This is when we level up

**36:32** · and start working with multiple crewmates

**36:34** · in parallel.

**36:34** · So let's spin up another tab in teams

**36:37** · and get more work started.

**36:39** · Now here's the problem.

**36:40** · In this directory I already have.

**36:42** · Good night.

**36:43** · Have fun running.

**36:44** · So if I spin up another agent

**36:46** · working in the same directory,

**36:47** · they will step on each other's

**36:49** · toes and cause conflicts.

**36:51** · The default solution

**36:52** · here is git work tree.

**36:54** · For those of you

**36:54** · who aren't familiar with it,

**36:56** · a guitar work

**36:57** · tree is basically creating

**36:58** · a clone of your report directory.

**37:00** · I can create one by typing git work tree

**37:03** · add and give a path here.

**37:07** · Now we have to think about a name.

**37:09** · This is when you waste five minutes

**37:11** · and eventually give up and just say hi.

**37:13** · Bit two.

**37:15** · Now we have a work tree

**37:16** · and we can navigate to it.

**37:18** · So let's go find it.

**37:20** · It's in high bit two.

**37:21** · This is a separate directory

**37:23** · on the file system.

**37:24** · So we can have an agent

**37:25** · doing anything here.

**37:26** · And it won't conflict

**37:27** · with good night to have fun,

**37:29** · which is running in the original report

**37:31** · directory.

**37:31** · The problem with work trees

**37:33** · is that we now have something

**37:35** · to maintain in our head.

**37:36** · I need to remember.

**37:38** · Oh, I have hybrid two here.

**37:40** · Next time I come into this hybrid

**37:42** · two directory

**37:43** · I would wonder

**37:44** · what was I doing in this work

**37:45** · tree last time?

**37:47** · Is there still an agent running or is it

**37:49** · All of

**37:50** · that has to

**37:50** · exist in my head,

**37:52** · and there is no way I'm

**37:53** · going to remember all that.

**37:54** · So this work tree

**37:56** · basically becomes a debt.

**37:57** · To get rid of it.

**37:58** · I need to run this remove command.

**38:02** · Remove.

**38:05** · This is just a lot of overhead.

**38:07** · My solution to

**38:08** · that is another tool

**38:09** · I built called Treehouse.

**38:11** · It's very simple.

**38:12** · I just come into this

**38:13** · repo and I run Treehouse.

**38:16** · It would drop me into a fresh work tree

**38:18** · where I can start doing whatever I want.

**38:21** · I can keep spinning up

**38:22** · more and more of this work trees

**38:24** · by running Treehouse again.

**38:27** · And if I want, I can see a list

**38:30** · of all the work trees

**38:32** · by typing Treehouse status.

**38:34** · So I can see

**38:35** · which ones are being used versus not.

**38:37** · When I'm done,

**38:38** · I can just close this tab

**38:39** · and Treehouse knows that I'm done,

**38:42** · so it will free up

**38:43** · that work tree for future use.

**38:45** · Next time I ask for work tree,

**38:47** · it will try to reuse one of the idol

**38:50** · work trees

**38:50** · instead of creating a brand new

**38:52** · So let's start some real work.

**38:54** · I have a bunch of user feedback

**38:56** · from my son's last round of playtesting,

**38:58** · so let me use this

**38:59** · first worksheet

**39:00** · we created and launch

**39:01** · cloud, and I will say,

**39:04** · I remember it's hard for the kid

**39:06** · to realize

**39:06** · they can press and hold

**39:08** · the voice input button to talk.

**39:10** · By default

**39:10** · they just click it

**39:11** · and then they will see a popover.

**39:13** · Maybe in the popover,

**39:14** · we add a label that tells them

**39:16** · they can also press and hold

**39:19** · and I'll enter.

**39:21** · Then I'll spin up a new tab

**39:23** · Treehouse Cloud, and this time I will say

**39:28** · the Image attachment dropdown

**39:29** · menu should have an action

**39:31** · that takes a screenshot

**39:32** · of the current app

**39:33** · and use that as the attachment.

**39:37** · All right, one more tab.

**39:39** · Treehouse cloud.

**39:44** · Our agent status bar right above the chat

**39:46** · input is not always showing bot activity.

**39:49** · Look into

**39:50** · what happened

**39:51** · there and make sure

**39:52** · when any bots are in progress,

**39:54** · it always displays

**39:55** · something that reflects

**39:56** · the latest activity.

**39:59** · Boom!

**40:00** · We now have three

**40:00** · sessions running in parallel.

**40:02** · Now I can keep going

**40:03** · because none of these sessions

**40:05** · will need my attention anytime soon,

**40:07** · especially if I tell them to run.

**40:09** · No mistakes after implementation.

**40:11** · I know

**40:11** · whether they need me

**40:13** · by looking at the top status bar,

**40:15** · and I can switch

**40:16** · between the tabs using keyboard

**40:17** · shortcuts like this.

**40:19** · That's very important

**40:20** · for managing a lot of parallel

**40:21** · sessions efficiently.

**40:23** · That said,

**40:24** · after doing this for a while,

**40:26** · you will discover that

**40:27** · juggling between all these sessions,

**40:29** · it's quite exhausting.

**40:31** · The constant context switch

**40:32** · and having to remind yourself

**40:34** · what each session was even doing

**40:36** · just doesn't feel like an ideal end

**40:38** · game experience.

**40:39** · So I kept pushing the boundary on this

**40:42** · and I discovered that

**40:44** · I needed a first mate,

**40:46** · someone I can talk to as a captain

**40:48** · that will carry out

**40:49** · all my directions and manage

**40:51** · all the crewmates for me

**40:53** · so I can focus on the big picture

**40:55** · like where should we go next?

**40:56** · not playing whack

**40:57** · a mole

**40:58** · with this

**40:58** · increasingly high number of crewmates,

**41:00** · this is how I level up

**41:02** · and truly become a captain.

**41:04** · My First mate is another free

**41:06** · and open source project

**41:07** · and it's very new.

**41:08** · The way to use it is by just cloning it.

**41:14** · And then I can run

**41:17** · an agent in this repository.

**41:19** · Now I just talk to it

**41:21** · and ask it to work on any projects

**41:23** · I like.

**41:24** · Let's say

**41:25** · I'd like to work on lavish

**41:27** · access, GitHub, Axi and Chrome dev tools.

**41:29** · Actually They are all GitHub projects

**41:31** · I own.

**41:32** · first mate is starting up

**41:33** · and the first time we run it

**41:35** · it will do some setup

**41:36** · and ask for some preferences,

**41:38** · but it's also just talking to it,

**41:39** · which is pretty easy.

**41:41** · you might wonder

**41:42** · why is the transcription so good?

**41:44** · Because it's

**41:45** · recognizing this project names.

**41:47** · Let me show you.

**41:49** · Open Silver Whisper actually supports

**41:52** · this customization

**41:54** · through a system prompt.

**41:56** · So what we can do

**41:57** · here is in this model menu

**42:00** · in the transcription menu

**42:01** · there is an initial prompt.

**42:03** · And we can put in some common vocabulary

**42:05** · that we use into this system prompt.

**42:08** · this prompt is

**42:09** · what makes the transcription really good.

**42:10** · First mate here is asking how strict

**42:13** · I want to be

**42:13** · with the code changes in this repos,

**42:15** · and I want to select full gates to PR.

**42:19** · This is basically going

**42:20** · to be using no mistakes

**42:21** · as the pipeline to validate its change

**42:25** · and first task.

**42:26** · Yeah, I'll describe it. Right now.

**42:29** · A real thing I want to do

**42:30** · is for all three

**42:32** · projects, I'd like to add an update

**42:34** · command on the CLI

**42:36** · that will update their

**42:37** · version to the latest on npm.

**42:41** · And let's see what First Mate does.

**42:43** · It realizes that this is not one task,

**42:46** · but three parallel tasks,

**42:47** · and it's now spinning up

**42:49** · these tabs in timox,

**42:51** · just like we be the scenes.

**42:53** · It would also call tree House

**42:54** · to create work trees,

**42:56** · and then run an agent in that work

**42:58** · tree to get the work done,

**42:59** · and then it will run.

**43:00** · No mistakes to validate the change

**43:02** · and get the PR ready for us to review.

**43:04** · Now you can see

**43:05** · it's first made that

**43:07** · it's doing the juggling.

**43:08** · I don't need to worry

**43:09** · about any of this now.

**43:10** · I can just keep giving it more work.

**43:13** · Hey first mate,

**43:14** · let's also look at the most recent

**43:16** · three open issues in lavish axillary

**43:19** · and let's discuss which

**43:20** · ones are actionable.

**43:23** · Boom!

**43:24** · First mate

**43:25** · now is pulling the open

**43:26** · issues from the repo

**43:27** · while waiting for the three background

**43:29** · agents working in parallel.

**43:31** · All right,

**43:31** · first mate said number 87 is cleanest.

**43:35** · It's very actionable.

**43:36** · And let me just see.

**43:38** · What is this?

**43:39** · Don't toggle in annotation mode.

**43:42** · Okay.

**43:44** · That's the clear bug.

**43:46** · All right, first mate, let's address

**43:49** · number 87.

**43:52** · Look, now first mate is struggling

**43:54** · a lot of tasks for me

**43:56** · that I otherwise

**43:57** · would have to manage by myself.

**43:59** · Watching it

**43:59** · context switch is actually

**44:01** · an oddly satisfying experience,

**44:03** · because I know that's what

**44:04** · I would have to do otherwise.

**44:06** · First mate is basically all my tools

**44:08** · coming together

**44:09** · as one cohesive workflow,

**44:11** · and I have been really happy with it.

**44:13** · It's been a pretty

**44:14** · significant improvement

**44:15** · to my overall experience

**44:17** · working with agents.

**44:18** · I highly recommend trying it out

**44:19** · if you are still directly talking

**44:21** · to every single agent session one by one,

**44:23** · it will be a pretty massive upgrade.

**44:26** · Something you start to notice

**44:27** · after having a first mate.

**44:28** · Is that because first mate took care

**44:31** · of so many things for you,

**44:32** · you start to run out of ideas

**44:34** · for what to ask you to do.

**44:36** · This is a good thing because it indicates

**44:38** · the bottleneck is shifting,

**44:40** · but it also means you,

**44:41** · as the captain, needs to keep up.

**44:44** · This requires a mindset shift

**44:46** · of focusing more of your energy

**44:48** · on understanding what matters

**44:50** · by talking to your users,

**44:52** · understanding the competitive landscape,

**44:54** · and crafting a good treasure

**44:56** · map that can lead your crew

**44:58** · to a good direction.

**45:00** · Once you started doing

**45:01** · that, congratulations!

**45:03** · You have successfully transitioned

**45:04** · from a sailor into a great captain.

**45:07** · All right.

**45:08** · We have gone from not having a ship

**45:10** · to being a captain

**45:11** · that has a first mate and a big crew

**45:14** · that sailed together.

**45:15** · This is a pretty good time

**45:17** · to wrap up this video.

**45:18** · All my tools can be found on my GitHub

**45:20** · and will be linked

**45:21** · in the description below.

**45:23** · They are all free and open source.

**45:25** · I built them

**45:26** · because I just want

**45:26** · to see more people learning

**45:28** · how to do

**45:28** · a genetic engineering

**45:29** · effectively and doing it

**45:31** · in an enjoyable way,

**45:32** · and that's what I hope

**45:34** · you can get out of this video.

**45:36** · I will continue to share

**45:37** · more of my workflow

**45:38** · and things

**45:38** · I find useful

**45:39** · on my channel,

**45:40** · so don't forget to subscribe

**45:41** · if you don't want to miss anything.

**45:44** · and see you next time!
