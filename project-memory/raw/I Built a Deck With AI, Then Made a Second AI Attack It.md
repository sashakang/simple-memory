What's really happening inside AI-built Office documents?

The common story is that ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot can now build a polished PowerPoint or Excel model in minutes, so the work is basically solved. The reality is more complicated. The output looks finished long before it's actually trustworthy, and a clean-looking deck with an undefendable number is worse than no deck at all.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on building Office files with AI agents at the center of the workflow:

 • Why a prompt asks for output but a workflow defines trust
 • How to run the four stages: sources, structure, creation, verification
 • What a hostile reviewer prompt catches that proofreading never will
 • Where AI is highest risk on your task risk gradient

For operators and teams, the upside is real and measured in weeks a year, but only if you build a truth layer around the file instead of dragging in messy sources and hoping the output holds.

## Transcript

_Caption track: English auto-generated or provided._

**0:00** · So, finally, this is the Excel

**0:02** · spreadsheet conversation. Finally, we

**0:04** · get to talk about what all of these

**0:06** · agents have made a difference for when

**0:08** · it comes to work and office files

**0:10** · because everything still lives in Word.

**0:12** · It lives in Excel. It lives in

**0:13** · PowerPoint. And when I did all of my

**0:16** · prompting guides and everything like

**0:17** · that last year, they were hugely popular

**0:19** · around Excel and PowerPoint. You can

**0:21** · still find them. They're still useful

**0:22** · for building individual assets, but we

**0:25** · have moved past individual asset

**0:27** · territory with what models can do now.

**0:30** · It just isn't the same thing. I I'm not

**0:32** · kidding you. I can now draft eight

**0:34** · simultaneous documents at once. I don't

**0:36** · think that's the ceiling. That's just

**0:37** · what I happened to do this week. And I

**0:39** · did it by focusing on the structure of

**0:42** · the data around the document so that

**0:44** · what I got was high high quality and

**0:46** · very powerful. You want to think beyond

**0:48** · that. You want to think in terms of how

**0:50** · you build an entire infrastructure

**0:53** · around agents that drives successful

**0:56** · artifact creation, whether that's Excel

**0:58** · or PowerPoint or something else. And

**1:00** · that mindset parallels a lot of what

**1:03** · we're seeing in the rest of the

**1:06** · workforce as we wrestle with what it

**1:08** · means to have agents in production in

**1:10** · 2026. Because the real, you know,

**1:13** · n-dimensional move, the big brain move

**1:15** · right now is not to think of it as I

**1:17** · bolt this onto my workflow, but to think

**1:19** · of it as agents are at the heart of the

**1:22** · new workflow. I therefore need to torque

**1:24** · myself around, change my process, adjust

**1:26** · everything inside so that agents are

**1:28** · centralized and agents are first. And so

**1:29** · a lot of what I'm going to talk about is

**1:31** · essentially how you rebuild an office

**1:34** · document workflow agentically. And

**1:36** · that's the theme. That's what makes this

**1:37** · really exciting because if you do that,

**1:39** · that's when you get to these massive

**1:41** · increases because if you think about it,

**1:43** · eight documents, 10 documents, whatever

**1:44** · it is, you're talking about an order of

**1:45** · magnitude increase in productivity on

**1:48** · just knowledge work. That's huge. And I

**1:50** · don't see that happening. In fact, I

**1:52** · know that's not happening because I have

**1:53** · talked to folks at Hyperscalers about

**1:55** · what I'm doing and they're like, "Oh,

**1:56** · wow. That's actually really cool. We

**1:57** · didn't know that these models could do

**1:59** · that." Well, they can. And we're going

**2:01** · to show you how. Claude can build Excel

**2:03** · and PowerPoint files. Chat GPT analyzes

**2:06** · any spreadsheet you drop into it. So

**2:07** · does Codeex. Microsoft Copilot for

**2:09** · Office hit general availability in

**2:11** · April. Everybody watching this video has

**2:13** · access to AI that can build a PowerPoint

**2:16** · deck in minutes. What you don't have is

**2:19** · a way to know that the deck is correct,

**2:21** · accurate, and complete. A and I know

**2:23** · this because I've lived it. Last

**2:25** · quarter, I opened an Excel file that

**2:26** · looked like a financial model.

**2:28** · Assumption inputs at the top, revenue

**2:29** · projections, valuation outputs rolling

**2:31** · up very cleanly. There was a written

**2:33** · guide attached saying the model had been

**2:35** · validated. And then I opened the revenue

**2:37** · growth row and the formula was incorrect

**2:39** · and it was copied across every future

**2:41** · year from the same two cells year after

**2:43** · year. Excel didn't tell me that. There

**2:45** · was no ref error. The valuation output

**2:47** · still looked good, but it was a

**2:49** · financial model in a costume. It wasn't

**2:52** · the real thing. The the layout was

**2:54** · right. The labels were right. The cells

**2:55** · were incorrect. And that's obviously the

**2:57** · only thing that matters. And the same

**2:59** · thing is happening in a lot of docs that

**3:01** · I see time after time in real production

**3:05** · environments. And in this video, I want

**3:08** · to fix that for you. I want to get into

**3:10** · how we build workflows for agents with

**3:12** · agents at the center that help us to

**3:15** · build these heavy knowledge work

**3:17** · documents in ways that ensure

**3:18** · reliability and accuracy. The key fix is

**3:21** · a mental shift. A prompt asks for an

**3:24** · output. A workflow defines the stages

**3:26** · the output has to pass through before it

**3:28** · can be trusted. And you need to be in a

**3:30** · workflow world, not a prompt world. So

**3:32** · for Office files, that workflow has four

**3:35** · stages. And we're going to go through

**3:37** · all four. One, you have to prepare your

**3:39** · sources. You do not ask for the deck or

**3:42** · the spreadsheet. You ask for an

**3:43** · inventory of what the model has to work

**3:46** · with, and you make sure that it's

**3:47** · organized. Two, structure. Before any

**3:51** · slide or formula gets created, AI needs

**3:53** · to produce a file specification. For a

**3:56** · deck, that's a narrative spine and a

**3:58** · slide list with claim headlines. For a

**4:00** · workbook, it should have a tab

**4:02** · architecture and a calculation flow. You

**4:04** · want to go from producing that spec to

**4:06** · then building the artifact. Right now,

**4:08** · you build the artifact constrained by

**4:10** · the source packet of information,

**4:12** · constrained by the spec that you've

**4:14** · built. You're not freestyling from

**4:16** · whatever the model thinks the answer

**4:18** · should be. And then four, verification.

**4:21** · The file isn't done when it opens. It's

**4:24** · done when it has survived a reviewer

**4:26** · that looks at it really aggressively. I

**4:28** · use another model for this. I actually

**4:29** · use codeex to build office artifacts and

**4:32** · then I use claude opus 4.7 to review

**4:35** · them aggressively and generate edit

**4:36** · loops. And it's like my own Ralph loop,

**4:38** · right? Where like it finishes and opus

**4:40** · looks at it and says, "Oh, you're not

**4:41** · finished. Here's your edit loop to make

**4:43** · it better." And I just keep running that

**4:45** · until I get a very high quality set of

**4:47** · docs. And I can run it at scale if my

**4:50** · document source repositories are clear.

**4:52** · I I'm increasingly thinking of knowledge

**4:54** · work as if it was code. So the

**4:56** · capability to generate these files is

**4:58** · absolutely everywhere and it's far

**5:00** · outpacing our ability to scale quality

**5:02** · unless we have these kinds of systems

**5:04** · like I'm talking about. I wrote about

**5:05** · the upstream piece of this on Substack

**5:07** · earlier this month about how to organize

**5:09** · your sources before you ever ask AI to

**5:11** · write anything. It's critical for this

**5:12** · kind of work to actually scale and call

**5:14** · that the before, right? This video is

**5:17** · the after, how you build with it. Uh, so

**5:19** · that link to the previous Substack is in

**5:21** · the description. If you're interested,

**5:22** · feel free to dive in. I think it's a

**5:24** · nice pair with this video. Let's get

**5:26** · back to it. The failures I worry about

**5:28** · aren't dramatic. They're ordinary enough

**5:30** · to survive a quick review. Right? A

**5:32** · board deck pulled from a folder

**5:34** · containing a Q3 actuals export and a Q4

**5:36** · plan file. The slide headline says,

**5:38** · "Revenue is ahead of plan." and the

**5:41** · chart looks really clean and then you

**5:43** · look at the underlying numbers and

**5:45** · they're blending actuals and plan data

**5:47** · because nobody labeled the difference

**5:49** · and that error travels every time the

**5:51** · deck gets shared. It traveled out of the

**5:52** · spreadsheet or wherever it came from

**5:54** · originally and it's a problem. So you

**5:56** · are now in a world where you can have a

**5:58** · great PowerPoint with sharp headlines

**6:00** · and executive language but there's no

**6:02** · way to show that it has a foundation. It

**6:05** · may look finished but it has no

**6:07** · foundation. And I want to talk to you

**6:09** · about how you build documents reliably

**6:12** · in a pipeline that are wellounded

**6:13** · because that's how you actually start to

**6:15** · build momentum with this knowledge work.

**6:17** · Otherwise, all of this AI tooling

**6:19** · becomes a massive trust breaker. And I

**6:22** · want to be clear, I'm not cherrypicking

**6:23** · edge cases here. Models are

**6:25** · goaloriented. If you tell them to build

**6:27** · something on a bad foundation, they'll

**6:30** · try to do it. And that's the normal

**6:32** · result of asking AI to jump straight

**6:34** · from messy sources to a finished file.

**6:36** · the model is optimizing for the artifact

**6:39** · you asked for. And if you ask for a deck

**6:41** · and don't give it choices, it'll try to

**6:42** · make a deck. Same thing with a

**6:44** · spreadsheet. Unless you explicitly

**6:46** · define the evidence structure, the tool

**6:48** · treats source discipline as optional.

**6:50** · And that's backwards. Source discipline

**6:52** · is a big part of the work. And I want to

**6:54** · call out this is not because the models

**6:57** · are getting worse. In fact, the models

**6:59** · have had a lot of work put into them to

**7:01** · care about sources. And if you give them

**7:03** · the chance to, they will. Part of why we

**7:06** · have to have this conversation now is

**7:08** · that the models are trained to check

**7:10** · claims and look at sources. And if you

**7:11** · don't take the same care as the models

**7:13** · do, the models will try to take that

**7:15** · care, try to look at sources. And that

**7:18** · very goalorientedness to build

**7:21** · completely will betray you because you

**7:24** · have no clean sources for it to rely on.

**7:26** · It will just have to work its way

**7:27** · through and guess, but it's been trained

**7:29** · to try and find it. So, it will try and

**7:31** · do that and it will guess and then

**7:33** · you'll be in trouble. And so we have to

**7:35** · be aware of where the hyperscalers are

**7:38** · taking the models. And the hyperscalers

**7:40** · are basically saying models need to do

**7:42** · better work by checking sources. They're

**7:43** · right, but we have to do the work of

**7:45** · making sure the sources and the workflow

**7:47** · pipelines are there so the models can

**7:49** · build these office documents

**7:50** · appropriately. And that's what serious

**7:52** · knowledge work looks like in 2026. The

**7:54** · goal is to make every important claim

**7:57** · and calculation something that can be

**7:59** · checked and that invites that scrutiny.

**8:01** · And so you have two stages here, right?

**8:03** · You have source prep. That's stage one.

**8:06** · Before you ask AI for the deck or the

**8:08** · workbook, you need to ask AI to look at

**8:10** · what it can see. What's in the folder?

**8:12** · Find out what your work packet has. Does

**8:14** · does everything in the work packet have

**8:16** · an owner and a date and a file type? And

**8:19** · can you create an index of evidence that

**8:21** · has all of that? Does it have a status?

**8:23** · Has the AI said if it's current data or

**8:25** · superseded? If it's an estimate, if it's

**8:27** · a transcript, if it's raw data, have you

**8:30** · removed sensitive material that would

**8:31** · need to be removed before any public-f

**8:33** · facing artifact gets generated? That

**8:35** · does happen, too. Uh, have you checked

**8:37** · your facts and your estimates based on

**8:39** · research on the net? This one move

**8:42** · changes the process. A messy folder can

**8:44** · become a controlled work packet. The AI

**8:46** · can't blend a transcript and a deck and

**8:48** · a spreadsheet and a half-remembered

**8:49** · assumption into a confident answer if

**8:51** · you've organized everything and if

**8:53** · there's an index of what's in there.

**8:55** · Stage two is structure. Before any file

**8:57** · gets created, you need to produce a file

**9:00** · specification. At least if you're doing

**9:02** · serious work. I'm not saying every

**9:03** · single time you have a conversation with

**9:04** · Jet GPT. Don't don't misunderstand me.

**9:06** · I'm saying when you're doing serious

**9:07** · knowledge work that has implications. So

**9:09** · for PowerPoint, that's the narrative in

**9:11** · English in a way that you understand.

**9:13** · And do insist on plain English. One of

**9:15** · the issues with the current models is

**9:16** · they like cute language. They like

**9:18** · shortorthhand. Insist on plain English.

**9:20** · Who is the audience? What decision do

**9:21** · they need to make? What do they need to

**9:23** · believe before they can make that

**9:24** · decision? And then look at the list of

**9:27** · slides. What are the claims? What are

**9:29** · the supporting source IDs? Where are

**9:30** · charts needed? What are the assumptions?

**9:32** · What are the open questions? And for

**9:34** · Excel, you need to look at your tab

**9:35** · architecture. Where does raw data live

**9:37** · in the tab? Where do the assumptions

**9:38** · live? Where are calculations performed?

**9:41** · Where are checks recorded? Where does

**9:42** · the user see the summary and how is it

**9:44** · driven? So the file spec is like a

**9:46** · blueprint for a serious doc. If the

**9:48** · blueprint doesn't explain where the

**9:51** · truth lives, the finished file won't do

**9:53** · that either. So, if you're wondering how

**9:55** · to get started, there is a full source

**9:56** · packet template on the Substack,

**9:59** · including an ID schema, a status

**10:00** · taxonomy, a conflict log format. If you

**10:03** · want to copy it for your team for the

**10:04** · next big project you do, I've linked it

**10:07** · in the description. Let's move on here,

**10:09** · though. I want to talk about file

**10:10** · creation. This is the part we all want,

**10:12** · right? How can we create this stuff? So

**10:15** · only now does AI actually build the

**10:17** · artifact. After you prep for PowerPoint,

**10:20** · I would do it in two passes. First pass

**10:22** · is the storyboard. You want slide titles

**10:24** · and claims and evidence and notes. Don't

**10:27** · design render yet. No charts laid out,

**10:29** · just the argument and the evidence

**10:31** · trail. Second pass, render the deck.

**10:34** · This split keeps visual polish from

**10:36** · hiding a weak argument. And you catch

**10:38** · unsupported claims before they become

**10:40** · beautiful and difficult to edit. Right

**10:42** · now I am doing all of the argumentation

**10:45** · in codec and I'm moving to claude opus

**10:47** · 4.7 for the render of the deck because

**10:49** · that front-end polish is just beautiful

**10:51** · and claude for Excel do it in three

**10:53** · layers. Layer one load the raw data

**10:56** · exactly. Layer two build the assumptions

**10:58** · in the calculation logic and layer three

**11:01** · produce the output views. A workbook

**11:03** · should be able to answer a very simple

**11:05** · question. If I change an assumption,

**11:07** · does the relevant output change for the

**11:09** · right reason? And that question matters

**11:11** · a lot more than whether the workbook

**11:12** · itself looks good. A spreadsheet that

**11:14** · cannot recalculate isn't a model. A

**11:17** · model whose formulas can't be inspected

**11:19** · isn't ready for decisioning. Right now,

**11:21** · what I am doing is I am using codeex to

**11:24** · build Excel models and then I am having

**11:27** · Claude take a pass at making them pretty

**11:29** · afterward. But I find that codeex is

**11:31** · really really good at completeness in

**11:33** · Excel files and that's really important

**11:35** · when you're trying to build serious

**11:36** · models. One more piece I want to call

**11:38** · out here. You need to understand your

**11:40** · task risk gradient. Where is AI highest

**11:43** · risk or lowest risk? AI is lowest risk

**11:45** · for formatting, layout exploration,

**11:47** · chart drafts, summary wording and

**11:49** · consistency checks. It's medium risk for

**11:51** · source attribution and data extraction.

**11:54** · And it's highest risk for numerical

**11:56** · synthesis, for financial calculations,

**11:58** · for any kind of regulatory language or

**12:00** · compliance language, and for claims that

**12:02** · will travel up to senior leadership for

**12:04** · a decision. Make sure you check those.

**12:07** · So yes, let the model help her

**12:09** · everywhere. No matter what the task risk

**12:10** · gradient is, it's faster with the model.

**12:12** · Now, don't give every task the same

**12:14** · review burden depending on the risk. If

**12:16** · you want to understand how to dig into

**12:18** · that further, there's more on that in

**12:19** · the substack. I broke down the full file

**12:21** · specification format. There's a

**12:23** · PowerPoint narrative spine template.

**12:25** · There's an Excel tab architecture.

**12:27** · There's assumption log fields. And there

**12:29** · are sort of checks, tab, smoke alarms

**12:31** · you can set in Excel that I put

**12:32** · together. So, if you want the full

**12:34** · version both for PowerPoint and Excel,

**12:36** · the link is in the description. We're

**12:38** · going to move on though to one of the

**12:39** · things I think is most important, and

**12:41** · that's verification with a hostile

**12:43** · reviewer prompt. So verification asks

**12:46** · whether the artifact can be trusted.

**12:48** · Sources, dates, formulas, assumptions,

**12:50** · charts, and unsupported claims. Every

**12:53** · one of these gets inspected. It's a

**12:54** · different job from proofreading, and

**12:56** · most teams tend to skip it because the

**12:58** · file can look done much sooner than it's

**13:00** · actually done. The useful pattern is to

**13:03** · make the model itself act as a hostile

**13:05** · reviewer. You you can use the same

**13:08** · model. I use different models for this.

**13:09** · I like to play them off against each

**13:11** · other. So, I use Opus 4.7 to review what

**13:14** · 5.5 does. I think that's super fun. Uh,

**13:16** · and I'm going to give you the prompt

**13:18** · right here. So, you know, pay attention.

**13:19** · So, the prompt is this. Read this Decker

**13:22** · workbook as a skeptical reviewer who

**13:24** · suspects every claim and every number.

**13:26** · For each slider sheet, identify claims

**13:29** · without source attribution, numbers

**13:31** · without a data source, charts whose

**13:33** · underlying data isn't traceable,

**13:35** · formulas inconsistent across parallel

**13:38** · rows or columns, and assumptions

**13:40** · presented as facts. Produce a written

**13:42** · list of every issue found. Don't fix

**13:44** · anything, just enumerate. That last

**13:47** · instruction, don't fix, just enumerate,

**13:49** · is what makes it work. The model is just

**13:51** · trying to find the problems. It's not

**13:52** · trying to solve them. different task,

**13:54** · different output, different value. A

**13:56** · model can catch a lot of its own

**13:58** · mistakes when you flip the task from

**14:00** · generation to enumeration. And the human

**14:02** · gate can stay on the consequential

**14:04** · claims, the numbers that travel, the

**14:06** · calls that are going to become an

**14:07** · important decision. And and one of the

**14:09** · things I want to call out here is my

**14:10** · personal workflow is very much a Ralph

**14:13** · loop for this. I will take a doc that is

**14:16** · created by codeex and I will give it to

**14:19** · opus 4.7 and I will ask opus 4.7 to do

**14:22** · that hostile review and generate an

**14:23** · extremely detailed edit list. I will

**14:26** · pipe that back to codeex and I will ask

**14:28** · codeex to fix everything in there with a

**14:31** · new version in the same folder. Then I

**14:34** · will go back to the same thread in open

**14:36** · 4.7 and say check the work. Did they do

**14:38** · the job? And then I will do it again and

**14:40** · I will do it again. And toward the end,

**14:42** · I will actually introduce a language

**14:44** · check. Opus is actually very very good

**14:46** · at checking for LLM isms like you're

**14:49** · absolutely right in the doc, right?

**14:51** · Something like that. And you can get it

**14:53** · into plain English that actually works

**14:55** · better for humans to read if you

**14:56** · introduce that polish step later. And

**14:58** · the overall goal is that you have an

**15:00** · autonomous loop between codeex and opus

**15:03** · that gets you to Alevel work without

**15:06** · having to invest a ton of time along the

**15:09** · way so that your time is best focused on

**15:11** · reading A-level material and saying,

**15:13** · "Okay, this is where I agree. This is

**15:15** · where I disagree. This is where I would

**15:17** · edit. Here's some final polish." And

**15:19** · that's what it looks like to do heavy

**15:21** · knowledge work in 2026. If we step back,

**15:24** · AI has made it much easier to create

**15:26** · Office files, right? And that matters a

**15:28** · lot. PowerPoint and Excel are still

**15:30** · where an enormous amount of business

**15:31** · judgment becomes visible inside

**15:33** · companies. And traditionally, they have

**15:34** · taken real hours out of everyone's week

**15:38** · in millions and millions of cases. If AI

**15:40** · helps people build those artifacts

**15:42** · faster, the productivity upside is real.

**15:45** · It's measured in weeks a year for all of

**15:47** · us. The upgrade is that you can now

**15:49** · build a repeatable production system

**15:51** · around the file. Source prep and

**15:53** · structure and constrained creation and

**15:55** · verification. The file is just an output

**15:58** · of that knowledge works system. It's not

**16:00** · the whole thing. Drag in the sources,

**16:02** · ask for a deck, hope the output is

**16:04** · right, that's the version of the

**16:05** · workflow that loses you a meeting.

**16:07** · Instead, if you prepare your sources and

**16:09** · define your structure and create the

**16:11** · file carefully and verify it, you're

**16:12** · going to be trusted more and more. So,

**16:15** · the next deck you build with AI should

**16:16** · not start with a deck. It should start

**16:18** · with the moves that I described. Right?

**16:20** · Write out a narrative spine before you

**16:22** · open the AI tool. Drop in your source

**16:24** · materials and ask for a source

**16:26** · inventory. Ask for a conflict log before

**16:28** · you try and make any slides. Generate

**16:30** · the storyboard with claims and notes

**16:32** · before any visual rendering. And then

**16:34** · run a hostile reviewer prompt before you

**16:37** · decide to share it out. The model can

**16:39** · help everywhere, but you have to keep

**16:41** · owning the truth. This is the your

**16:43** · polish stopped meaning trust. The

**16:45** · companies that build a truth layer

**16:46** · around their AI office files are going

**16:48** · to ship a lot faster and be wrong much

**16:51** · less. The ones that don't are going to

**16:53** · put out a really nice looking deck next

**16:55** · quarter with a number that nobody can

**16:57** · defend. And by the way, if you think

**16:58** · that's not true, I want you to remember

**17:00** · that the team at OpenAI did that with a

**17:04** · chart that chat GPT presumably helped

**17:07** · make in the chat GPT5 launch. And the

**17:11** · chart was famously wrong and everyone

**17:12** · had a good chuckle and that happens to

**17:15** · the best of us. We can do better than

**17:17** · that. I want to answer one question to

**17:20** · close us off and I think I I I think a

**17:22** · number of you will ask this and it's

**17:24** · simple. Nate, why is it this hard? I

**17:28** · have to build this entire effectively

**17:29** · knowledge work harness on my own. Why do

**17:32** · I have to do that? Why hasn't someone

**17:34** · made this for me so it's easier and it's

**17:36** · just push a button simple? I have a

**17:38** · really clear answer for you. Knowledge

**17:40** · work is profoundly contingent on domain

**17:44** · knowledge. That's why it's knowledge

**17:45** · work. If you are going to do knowledge

**17:48** · work that is specific and memorable and

**17:51** · useful and deep, you have to be deep

**17:54** · enough in theformational

**17:56** · context that you can custom assemble the

**17:59** · pieces of information you need to make a

**18:02** · useful artifact. It's not something you

**18:05** · can generically turn into a workflow.

**18:08** · It's not that simple. It's not like you

**18:10** · can assume there are five slots for

**18:11** · evidence for a PowerPoint deck and good

**18:13** · luck if you have more than five. No one

**18:15** · who does serious knowledge work thinks

**18:16** · like that. And so I think part of the

**18:19** · reason we have to build our own, it's

**18:21** · sort of like Luke Skywalker making his

**18:23** · own lightsaber. You have to understand

**18:25** · how the system works to become a master

**18:27** · at that system. And I am sure that there

**18:30** · are startups out there that are working

**18:32** · on making parts of this simpler, parts

**18:35** · of gathering the information simpler,

**18:37** · parts of communicating that review step

**18:40** · simpler, parts of checking the work and

**18:42** · checking sort of the calculations on

**18:44** · Excel simpler. All of those pieces are

**18:47** · problems that we can get better at

**18:49** · solving. But I don't want to lose sight

**18:51** · of the fact that good deep knowledge

**18:53** · work is tremendously detailed. reality

**18:56** · has a surprising amount of detail. Good

**18:58** · deep knowledge work is extremely

**19:00** · detailed and it's difficult to

**19:02** · generalize an abstraction like an

**19:04** · abstracted knowledge work harness over

**19:06** · that level of detail. So that's the

**19:07** · honest answer for you. That's why we

**19:10** · can't just get a push button answer from

**19:12** · Microsoft that makes Excel superpowered

**19:14** · for this. There you go. I if wishes were

**19:17** · fishes, right? I wish it was that way.

**19:18** · But instead, we get to work at this. And

**19:21** · by the way, for everyone saying we'll

**19:22** · lose our brains when we use AI, this is

**19:24** · a great example of why you got to keep

**19:25** · your brain turned on when you use AI.
