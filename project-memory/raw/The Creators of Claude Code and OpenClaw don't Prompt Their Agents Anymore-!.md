The best AI engineers barely prompt their agents anymore. Sounds crazy I know! They build a loop that does the prompting for them and let it run for hours while they step away. The head of Claude Code at Anthropic put it bluntly: he doesn't prompt Claude, he has loops running that prompt Claude for him.

The only problem is this gets expensive (and hallucinations compound) - you need a harness with observability that can run reliably not always using the expensive frontier models.

So I built one! It's a TypeScript app that runs Pi (on Kimi) in a loop, stores every run in a database, and shows it all in a dashboard. And the loop isn't one agent on repeat, it's agents prompting agents: an orchestrator decides the next tasks and spins up workers to run them in parallel. Think of it like an advanced Ralph loop with more control!

_Caption track: English auto-generated or provided._

**0:00** · Apparently, we're not even supposed to

**0:01** · be prompting our AI coding assistants

**0:03** · anymore. The real skill is designing

**0:06** · loops that prompt your agents so they

**0:07** · work for you 24/7. And I got to say, I

**0:10** · am not sold on this idea right now. It

**0:13** · feels like some of the bigger players in

**0:15** · the AI space like Peter Steinberger, the

**0:17** · creator of open claw, Boris Cherney is

**0:19** · doing this as well, the lead at Claude

**0:21** · code. They're pushing this new fad

**0:23** · whether they like it or not of loop

**0:25** · engineering. It's becoming the next

**0:27** · buzzword and I promise I'm not going to

**0:29** · be hyping up loop engineering here.

**0:31** · There are some good lessons to be

**0:33** · learned from what's surfacing, but also

**0:35** · with loops and you probably seen this

**0:37** · with dynamic workflows in Claude code

**0:39** · for example, they're not always the most

**0:40** · reliable and they are extremely token

**0:43** · hungry. So unless you have an infinite

**0:45** · budget like Peter pretty much, then you

**0:48** · have to be really careful with these

**0:49** · kinds of systems. They're not always

**0:52** · practical. And so that's what I want to

**0:54** · cover with you in this video. I just

**0:56** · want to get really honest and really

**0:57** · practical with you. We're going to cover

**0:58** · three things. We're going to cover loops

**1:00** · in a really simple sense. It's not

**1:02** · actually that complicated. So I want to

**1:04** · show you how you can run these and then

**1:05** · I want to talk about the trade-offs and

**1:07** · then solutions to that. So really nice

**1:09** · and structured here. And so as far as

**1:11** · some of the solutions we'll get into

**1:12** · towards the end of the video, I want to

**1:14** · show you how we can build a system where

**1:16** · we can really observe the loops, the

**1:18** · orchestrators and the workers, how we

**1:20** · can optimize for cost with the workflows

**1:22** · we build and using different providers

**1:24** · like Pi. And so it really it's like

**1:26** · here's how you can run loops. Here are

**1:28** · the downsides. Here is how we can solve

**1:29** · for them and really get to the point

**1:31** · where we're building harnesses for these

**1:34** · longer running tasks because it is

**1:35** · really powerful for certain things, but

**1:38** · then also covering the honest trade-offs

**1:40** · with it. Okay, so we saw what Peter

**1:41** · said. Now let's take a look at what

**1:43** · Boris, the creator of Claude code, said

**1:45** · and it is really similar. He said, "I

**1:47** · don't prompt Claude anymore. I write

**1:49** · loops and the loops do the work. My job

**1:51** · is to write loops." Okay, Boris, I think

**1:54** · we get it. And like I said, loop

**1:56** · engineering is kind of a buzzword, but

**1:58** · also there are some really good

**1:59** · takeaways when you dive into this. So

**2:01** · like Boris through a lot of like

**2:02** · interviews and podcasts has shared his

**2:05** · workflow. We can get glimpses into how

**2:06** · it works. A [clears throat] lot of it is

**2:08** · built around the newer features in

**2:10** · Claude Code. Like {slash} loop is the

**2:12** · most basic example. And I told you we're

**2:14** · going to simplify things here. Loop

**2:15** · engineering is really not that

**2:17** · complicated. I don't even know if it

**2:18** · deserves its own term. And so with

**2:21** · {slash} loop we set an interval for

**2:23** · running a prompt. So like for example,

**2:24** · every 5 minutes I'm going to check for

**2:27** · new GitHub issues in this repo and

**2:30** · handle any that come in. So it's pretty

**2:32** · neat. We set up Claude to basically wake

**2:34** · itself up every 5 minutes and of course

**2:36** · you can adjust this and it's going to

**2:38** · look for input in an external system

**2:40** · like GitHub for example. And so as long

**2:43** · as our terminal is up and running with

**2:45** · Claude Code, it's able to autonomously

**2:47** · handle this. So basically it's a every

**2:49** · 5-minute loop looking at GitHub issues.

**2:52** · There's also {slash} goal that we have

**2:54** · in Claude Code and Codex. So we set some

**2:56** · criteria like here is how you know you

**2:59** · are done and then we're forcing the

**3:00** · coding agent to work until it is done.

**3:03** · Kind of like Ralph loops that went viral

**3:05** · a few months ago.

**3:07** · And then last we have {slash} routines.

**3:08** · And so these are the scheduled jobs.

**3:10** · Like every hour I want you to wake up,

**3:12** · look at some larger spec document and

**3:14** · then handle the next task. And so really

**3:17** · loop engineering is combining or

**3:19** · creating a system around all of these

**3:21** · things. Routines, {slash} loop so that

**3:23** · we can give a larger scope of work as

**3:26** · input to an AI coding assistant and have

**3:28** · it work through it incrementally, right?

**3:30** · Cuz we never want to have a coding agent

**3:32** · try to handle too much at once or it

**3:34** · will get completely overwhelmed. And the

**3:36** · main idea with loop engineering is we

**3:38** · want to have some main orchestrator

**3:40** · agent that we talk to. We do minimal

**3:41** · prompting, just telling it what we want

**3:43** · at a high level and it figures out how

**3:45** · to set up the loop and the entire

**3:47** · system. And it's really easy to do this

**3:50** · in Claude Code. This is really cool. You

**3:52** · just tell it to use the loop skill. So,

**3:54** · there's a capability built right into

**3:56** · the tool where it knows how to set up

**3:58** · these loop systems based on what we ask

**3:59** · it to do. So, I passed in some kind of

**4:01** · simple spec document here like I just

**4:03** · have this as an example. These are the

**4:05** · tasks that we want it to go through

**4:06** · incrementally. And so, my prompt is

**4:08** · telling it to load the skill so it knows

**4:10** · how to set up the loop. And then every

**4:12** · cycle it's just going to do the first

**4:13** · unchecked task, do the validation, and

**4:16** · then that loop is done. And then on the

**4:17** · next loop, it'll go through and do the

**4:19** · next task. And so, eventually all the

**4:21** · tasks will be complete and then our

**4:23** · primary Claude code session here that

**4:25** · set up everything is going to report

**4:27** · back to us, right? So, like right here

**4:29** · Claude code is sort of the orchestrator,

**4:31** · but then also the workers cuz it sets up

**4:34** · the loop itself. But, it is really cool

**4:36** · to watch this run. So, I'll send off a

**4:37** · request here and I'll wait for it to run

**4:40** · a little bit. I'll come back and show

**4:41** · you kind of how it works. But, you can

**4:43** · see that it loads the loop skill as the

**4:45** · very first thing. So, it knows how to

**4:46** · orchestrate things and it'll do the

**4:48** · {slash} loop by itself that I just

**4:50** · showed how you can do manually. Okay, so

**4:52** · I came back a couple of minutes later

**4:54** · and it's already done with the first two

**4:55** · tasks. So, it's gone through two

**4:57** · iterations of the loop already. And so,

**4:59** · if we go up to the top, we can see that

**5:01** · it says this is a sequential task list.

**5:03** · It's going to do the first task and then

**5:04** · it's going to schedule a quick wake up.

**5:06** · So, it sets up the {slash} loop by

**5:08** · itself. And if we scroll down a little

**5:10** · bit after it does and validates the

**5:12** · first task, we can see that it's

**5:14** · resuming with a {slash} loop wake up.

**5:16** · And look at that. I didn't write this

**5:18** · prompt myself at all. I know this is a

**5:20** · very, very basic example, but I want to

**5:22** · stay simple on purpose, but it wrote the

**5:25** · prompt. {slash} loop work through

**5:26** · plan.md one task at a time. And so, the

**5:30** · kinds of systems that Boris is building

**5:32** · is obviously going to be a lot more

**5:33** · elaborate with how we're telling it to

**5:35** · run the looping and building in routines

**5:37** · and describing how we want it to prompt

**5:39** · and work through our context, but at the

**5:41** · basic sense, this is really all it

**5:43** · takes. And so, now it's just going to

**5:45** · keep knocking things out one at a time.

**5:48** · So, that is loop engineering in the most

**5:50** · basic form possible. But, now I want to

**5:53** · get into some of the downsides here,

**5:55** · which some of them are definitely pretty

**5:57** · obvious to you already. Problem number

**6:00** · one, there is no way you're going to

**6:01** · convince me that loop engineering is the

**6:03** · way to get the best results possible

**6:05** · with AI coding assistance. I mean, come

**6:08** · on, this has to be a hyperbole here.

**6:09** · Boris Journey says that their AI Daisy

**6:11** · manages tens of thousands of AI agents

**6:14** · at once. Like, really? Is is that

**6:16** · actually practical? Is that going to

**6:18** · scale? Like, are you really building

**6:20** · Claude code with tens of thousands of

**6:22** · agents per day? I mean, maybe that does

**6:24** · explain some of the bugs we have in

**6:25** · Claude code. I feel like there's

**6:27** · constantly a couple annoying ones. But,

**6:29** · yeah, overall, I I like building these

**6:30** · kinds of loops, if we make it a very

**6:32** · tight controlled system, that's what

**6:34** · I'll talk about in a little bit, I think

**6:36** · it's good. And for building proof of

**6:37** · concepts and exploring ideas, like I

**6:39** · think it's really good. But, it's not

**6:42** · like I want to drive all my AI coding

**6:44** · with them. And then the second big

**6:46** · problem is cost, because with loop

**6:48** · engineering, we're relying on some kind

**6:49** · of orchestrator to set up the system and

**6:52** · really determine how to get to the end

**6:54** · goal. So, it figures out how many

**6:56** · workers to spin off, how many loops to

**6:57** · do, and that gets super expensive. So,

**7:00** · the dashboard that I built, that I'll

**7:02** · show you at the end of this video, I

**7:03** · built cost tracking into it. And so, for

**7:06** · a single run, like here are all the

**7:07** · loops that the orchestrator went

**7:08** · through, it costed me over a million

**7:10** · tokens just to build a relatively simple

**7:13** · application. And yes, I'm sure there are

**7:15** · a lot of optimizations that I can do

**7:17** · here. But, I think you can see just by

**7:19** · looking at this, I mean, this is part

**7:21** · part of why I built the dashboard, you

**7:22** · can see why it would be so expensive.

**7:25** · Because we send in our initial spec to

**7:27** · the orchestrator, and it has to reason

**7:29** · about that and then figure out how many

**7:30** · workers to spin off, then it has to

**7:32** · prompt them all,

**7:33** · and they each spend tokens, and then the

**7:35** · results come back, the orchestrator has

**7:37** · to then reason about that again, and

**7:38** · then send off the next wave. No matter

**7:40** · how you design the system, there's a lot

**7:43** · of context passing and reasoning to make

**7:45** · everything work here in a distributed

**7:47** · way. So, it's a really powerful system

**7:50** · and it's cool how far you can take this

**7:52** · kind of stuff with the self-validation.

**7:54** · But, man, does it get so expensive. And

**7:57** · then really quick, the third problem

**7:59** · with loop engineering is at least for a

**8:01** · lot of setups, you're not really working

**8:03** · between different coding agent sessions.

**8:05** · Like when you're just using slash loop

**8:06** · in Claude code like Boris talks about a

**8:08** · lot, it's really just continuing in the

**8:11** · same coding agent session. So, if you

**8:13** · loop for a while, you're going to

**8:14** · completely bloat your context for your

**8:17** · LLM and overwhelm it. And so, we need a

**8:19** · system where we can distribute the work

**8:22** · actually between different coding agent

**8:25** · sessions and make it so they can all

**8:27** · communicate to each other and have an

**8:28** · idea of like where they fit in the

**8:30** · larger goal. And so, that's what I want

**8:33** · to cover for the rest of the video here.

**8:35** · So, I want to talk about how I actually

**8:37** · work on a day-to-day basis because this

**8:39** · will cover how we can solve for a lot of

**8:41** · these problems we have with loop

**8:42** · engineering. So, I use my tool Arkon,

**8:45** · but I'm not just trying to like push

**8:46** · Arkon on you here. I just want to talk

**8:48** · about how I use it in a way that solves

**8:51** · for the problems of cost, reliability,

**8:54** · and how do we actually orchestrate many

**8:56** · different coding agent sessions. And so,

**8:59** · go through this with me here. So, Arkon

**9:01** · is my harness builder. It allows us to

**9:03** · build workflows that orchestrate many

**9:06** · coding agent sessions to handle larger

**9:08** · tasks. And so, for example, a really

**9:11** · classic AI coding workflow is you do

**9:13** · your planning, you do your

**9:14** · implementation, and then you do your

**9:17** · code review or your testing. And so, we

**9:19** · can build this as a single Arkon

**9:21** · workflow. There's a ton of content that

**9:23** · I have on Arkon on my channel. I'll link

**9:25** · to a video right here to help you get

**9:26** · started if you're interested in this.

**9:28** · But again, I just want to focus on like

**9:29** · how I use this on a day-to-day basis to

**9:33** · kind of do loops. Like you can do loop

**9:35** · engineering with Arkon. You can build a

**9:36** · Ralph loop with Arkon.

**9:39** · So, I'll show you an example of a

**9:40** · workflow here. If I go into the default

**9:42** · workflows, there's a ton that we have

**9:44** · that ship with Arkon. Let's take a look

**9:46** · at fix GitHub issue, for example. And

**9:49** · so, I don't want to get too in the weeds

**9:50** · here, but I just want to show you really

**9:51** · quickly at a high level how this

**9:53** · workflow works. And another really

**9:55** · important thing with Arkon is that we're

**9:57** · not having the agent drive the entire

**10:00** · thing. It's more deterministic because

**10:02** · we set up the process in this workflow

**10:04** · file, and then we even have certain

**10:06** · steps that are deterministic. Like the

**10:08** · agent is not driving it, we are

**10:10** · guaranteeing that it's going to happen.

**10:12** · So, when we're building these loops and

**10:14** · larger tasks that we have our coding

**10:16** · agent knock out, we want to actually

**10:18** · take the decision away from the coding

**10:20** · agent as much as we can, only applying

**10:22** · the reasoning of the LLM when we

**10:24** · actually need it to write the code, for

**10:25** · example. Like we might want our agent to

**10:27** · write the code, but not actually decide

**10:29** · the tests to run because we know what it

**10:31** · looks like for our tests to pass.

**10:33** · And so, for this workflow, first we

**10:35** · extract the issue number. So, the input

**10:37** · here is some GitHub issue that we want

**10:39** · to fix or address. So, we extract the

**10:41** · context, we fetch the issue context, and

**10:45** · then we classify it. So, we have a large

**10:47** · language model decide at first, are we

**10:49** · addressing a bug or are we implementing

**10:51** · a new feature? And then the workflow is

**10:54** · going to be dynamic based on that

**10:56** · decision. So, the kind of thing that

**10:57** · your orchestrator would usually decide,

**11:00** · we're more enforcing

**11:02** · process here. Like this is the kind of

**11:04** · thing that I want to sort of layer on

**11:05** · top of loop engineering. Like let me be

**11:07** · in the loop, let me determine how the

**11:10** · workflow can progress. And so, then we

**11:12** · research the issue, investigate it, and

**11:15** · then we go do the implementation and the

**11:17** · validation, and we create the pull

**11:18** · request, right? Step by step, each one

**11:20** · of the steps we're using markdown

**11:22** · documents as context. So, we're handing

**11:25** · things off between the steps, but then

**11:27** · each step is running in its own coding

**11:28** · agent session. So, if we're handling a

**11:30** · larger GitHub issue, it's not like this

**11:32** · entire thing is running with slash

**11:33** · looping Claude code getting totally

**11:35** · overwhelmed with the each of the tasks

**11:36** · that we're doing as we're planning,

**11:38** · implementing, and validating. And the

**11:40** · way that I can manage cost here is every

**11:43** · single node in this Arkon workflow, I

**11:46** · can actually decide what model am I

**11:48** · going to use. And so, for example, with

**11:51** · the classify step here at the top when

**11:53** · we're figuring out, you know, what kind

**11:54** · of issue do we need to address in the

**11:55** · rest of the workflow? This is kind of

**11:57** · like the orchestrator decision. We can

**11:59** · use a small model, like maybe using

**12:01** · Haiku or MiniMax M3 Kimmy K2.7, for

**12:05** · example, right? Like what we can do in

**12:07** · Arkon is even mix providers. So, we can

**12:09** · use Claude code for the implementation,

**12:12** · and then we can use Codex for the

**12:13** · review, and then for all of our context

**12:15** · loading and exploration up front, we can

**12:18** · use a smaller model like Kimmy K2.7.

**12:21** · And so, that's one of the other big

**12:22** · issues I see with using slash goal or

**12:25** · routines or loops in Claude code is

**12:27** · you're just using one model for pretty

**12:28** · much everything. That's part of the

**12:30** · problem why it's so expensive. Cuz when

**12:32** · we're doing larger amounts of work like

**12:34** · this, of course, you're going to have to

**12:36** · spend more tokens, but you don't always

**12:38** · need to spend the most per token for

**12:41** · every step of your workflow. And I know

**12:44** · I'm really, really driving this in the

**12:45** · ground right now, but yet another reason

**12:47** · you want some kind of harness like what

**12:48** · you can build with Arkon is we have

**12:50** · durability. So, this is my Neon

**12:52** · database. I'm storing all of my logs and

**12:55** · runs in Postgres so that I can resume a

**12:59** · workflow even if my machine goes down or

**13:01** · I cancel things, like whatever I do, I'm

**13:03** · always able to resume on exactly the

**13:05** · step that I was in that larger loop or

**13:07** · that larger workflow. So, I have all my

**13:09** · conversations, the code bases that I'm

**13:11** · operating on with Arkon. Everything is

**13:14** · durable, and it's super easy to resume

**13:16** · any work that I'm doing. Okay, cool. So,

**13:18** · now I want to show you how I actually

**13:20** · use Arkon on a day-to-day basis. A lot

**13:22** · of ties that we can draw to loop

**13:24** · engineering and things that I really

**13:26** · fixed with it, right? And so, at a very,

**13:28** · very basic sense, one of the most

**13:30** · classic workflows that I use with Argon

**13:32** · is fixing GitHub issues. Most of the

**13:35** · input for my day-to-day work is issues

**13:37** · in a repo. Either I'll create them or

**13:39** · someone else will. And so, we can use

**13:41** · Argon to send off workflows to run in

**13:44** · parallel handling multiple GitHub issues

**13:46** · at the exact same time. And this is very

**13:49** · much like loop engineering because we

**13:51** · have our primary Claude code here as our

**13:54** · orchestrator and it's figuring out based

**13:56** · on my higher-level request, I'm going to

**13:58** · create the prompts and dispatch the

**14:00** · workflows. Work trees are also a really

**14:02** · important part of loop engineering.

**14:04** · Boris talks about this as well. If we're

**14:06** · having many different agents handling

**14:07** · tasks in a loop, we need to make sure

**14:09** · they're running in isolation so they're

**14:11** · not stepping on each other's toes. That

**14:13** · is how we scale our output with AI

**14:15** · coding assistance. And so, we have our

**14:17** · Claude code here kicking off four

**14:19** · workflows to handle GitHub issues. It's

**14:21** · going to validate the PRs after make

**14:25** · sure that they're actually created. And

**14:26** · this is where we can come in with human

**14:27** · in the loop as well. And then it'll run

**14:30** · four more workflows to validate, like

**14:32** · perform a code review on each of the

**14:34** · issues as well. So, very comprehensive,

**14:36** · kind of a loop in the sense where it's

**14:37** · like handle the issues, validate, and

**14:39** · then do a code review. And uh and other

**14:42** · thing as far as like making this more

**14:43** · reliable is with Argon workflows, we can

**14:45** · also build human in the loop within any

**14:48** · individual node in the workflow. So, we

**14:50** · can always have it pause for us to

**14:51** · validate something before it continues,

**14:53** · which is one of the biggest problems

**14:54** · with loop engineering right now in

**14:56** · general is that a lot of times people

**14:58** · set up these systems to just go, go, go,

**14:59** · go. And then you have it run for a day

**15:02** · and by the time it comes back, you just

**15:03** · have crap. Like I've had that myself as

**15:05** · I've tested a lot of things within

**15:07** · Claude code like routines and slash

**15:09** · loop. And so, I'll send this off here

**15:11** · and I'll just pause and come back once

**15:13** · it's done so we can walk through

**15:15** · everything that it accomplished here.

**15:17** · And the best part about all of this is

**15:19** · we We have nine coding agent sessions

**15:22** · for this entire loop or whatever you

**15:24** · want to call it, this entire harness,

**15:26** · right? Like one per GitHub issue fix,

**15:28** · one per review, and then we have our

**15:29** · primary orchestrator. So, we're doing a

**15:31** · ton of work, but at the same time, we

**15:34** · actually are pretty lean for each

**15:36** · individual session. Because I actually

**15:38** · kind of have to correct myself, it's

**15:39** · more than just nine sessions because

**15:41** · even within each individual Arkon

**15:42** · workflow, we're running separate coding

**15:45** · agent sessions where we can have

**15:46** · different models. We can optimize for

**15:47** · cost. There is a lot of engineering that

**15:50** · goes on behind the scenes here. All

**15:51** · right, so I'm back after the entire

**15:54** · thing ran. I just want to show you how

**15:56** · comprehensive we can be here. And so, we

**15:58** · have the four workflow runs for actually

**16:00** · fixing the issues, and then Cloud Code

**16:02** · here is really monitoring and

**16:04** · orchestrating everything, right? So,

**16:05** · like as the different tasks are done,

**16:07** · it's coming in and checking on them. And

**16:09** · then finally, we have everything done

**16:11** · together. So, all four fixed workflows

**16:12** · are done. And then it launches the code

**16:15** · reviews cuz it confirmed that all of the

**16:17** · pull requests are ready to be reviewed.

**16:20** · And you can even ask for a status

**16:21** · update. So, like while the Arkon

**16:22** · workflows are running, if we want to see

**16:24** · where we're at, we can of course check

**16:25** · the logs in the Arkon web UI. I have

**16:27** · that as well. But then also, we can just

**16:29** · ask our orchestrator, right? Cuz it

**16:31** · really is in control of our entire

**16:33** · situation here.

**16:35** · And then finally, all the reviews are

**16:37** · done and it gives us the things that

**16:39** · need our attention now. So, we can

**16:40** · really come in and direct things from

**16:42** · here. So, it's the harness driving

**16:44** · everything, but we still can be in the

**16:45** · loop wherever we want. And I know

**16:47** · there's a lot that goes into effectively

**16:50** · orchestrating parallel coding agents.

**16:52** · So, there's a lot of content on my

**16:54** · channel where I cover this kind of

**16:55** · thing. Like for example, one thing that

**16:57** · you have to do a lot is branches in your

**16:59** · database, right? Like if each coding

**17:01** · agent is working on something in

**17:02** · parallel, you don't want them to be

**17:04** · stepping on each other's toes, not just

**17:05** · with code changes, but also database

**17:07** · changes. So, work trees in Neon is a

**17:09** · super powerful thing. A lot of different

**17:11** · things like port conflicts that we want

**17:13** · to solve for as well. So, I'll link to a

**17:14** · video right here where I cover that

**17:16** · stuff. And just generally how we can

**17:18** · make parallel AI coding more reliable.

**17:20** · So, assuming you take care of all of

**17:21** · that, you can really let Arkon rip on as

**17:24** · many GitHub issues or whatever in

**17:26** · parallel. Very cool how far we can take

**17:28** · our output here. All right, so we have

**17:30** · covered a lot in this video already.

**17:33** · Loop engineering basics, the downsides

**17:34** · of it, how I'm using Arkon to extract

**17:36** · the good parts out into more

**17:38** · deterministic workflows. But last, I

**17:40** · want to cover a system that I built for

**17:43** · loop engineering in its purest form.

**17:45** · Because I presented these issues to you,

**17:47** · but I I do see a lot of promise with

**17:49** · this. I want to try to build a system

**17:51** · that solves for these problems. And so,

**17:54** · I built this dashboard that I'm really

**17:56** · excited to show you right now. I

**17:57** · actually have it open-sourced on GitHub,

**17:59** · linked to this in the description. And I

**18:02** · have built this to solve for a lot of

**18:03** · the problems that we have with loop

**18:05** · engineering right now. So, first of all,

**18:07** · we have durability. Uh just like with

**18:09** · Arkon, all of the loops that we run and

**18:12** · the different events and logs, I'm

**18:13** · storing this here so we can always

**18:15** · resume a workflow later on.

**18:18** · So, we're managing all of our state in

**18:20** · an external database, so we're not

**18:22** · relying on that staying in any coding

**18:24** · agent session. And so, our main

**18:26** · orchestrator, it is going to read

**18:29** · through this state here and then figure

**18:31** · out like, "Okay, what is the next thing

**18:32** · that we need to do?" And so, then it's

**18:34** · going to call upon the workers to

**18:36** · accomplish all of that. Like, build a

**18:37** · new feature, do some kind of validation,

**18:39** · whatever it needs to do. And then those

**18:41** · workers are going to go back and they're

**18:42** · going to update the state that we have

**18:44** · in our database.

**18:47** · Like again, I'm using Neon for Postgres

**18:49** · here. And so, this is our loop, right?

**18:51** · Cuz in the next time the orchestrator

**18:53** · runs, it's going to get that updated

**18:54** · state from the workers and then figure

**18:56** · out the next workers to invoke. And

**18:58** · there are a couple of problems that I'm

**19:00** · solving by building something like this.

**19:02** · And And I want to start by saying like,

**19:04** · this is more experimental. I'm just

**19:05** · showing you something that I'm working

**19:06** · on and kind of building into my own

**19:08** · second brain. But first of all, I'm

**19:09** · driving everything with Pi. So, I'm

**19:12** · actually using my Kimmy now Kimmy K 2.7,

**19:15** · to drive all of these workflows. So,

**19:17** · yes, it is a lot of tokens, but I'm not

**19:19** · using Opus for everything, but I'm still

**19:21** · getting really good results because of

**19:23** · the harness that I built here that

**19:25** · elevates the model. And then, I have a

**19:28** · lot of observability built into this

**19:30** · dashboard. I mean, obviously, it being a

**19:31** · dashboard, it solves part of that

**19:33** · reliability problem, which obviously I'm

**19:35** · still working on, but just being able to

**19:36** · see exactly the decisions that are going

**19:38** · on here means that it's easier for me to

**19:41** · uh look at this, even have my coding

**19:43** · agent analyze the runs in the database,

**19:45** · and then figure out how to improve the

**19:47** · loop, how to improve the harness here.

**19:50** · And so, I just have been going through a

**19:52** · lot of really simple examples, but like

**19:54** · non-trivial enough where it does have to

**19:56** · go through quite a few rounds to build

**19:57** · it. So, like building a single-page

**19:59** · Kanban board as a static web app, I just

**20:01** · take this prompt, and I'll show you it

**20:03** · running live right now. Like, I'll just

**20:04** · send this in, and I will start a loop.

**20:07** · And it's really cool. We can see that

**20:08** · like the orchestrator is deciding how to

**20:10** · split up the work right now. And then,

**20:12** · we also have like the full run history

**20:14** · here. It's pretty neat. Like, it's super

**20:15** · easy to get this up and running uh if

**20:17** · you just want to check out the GitHub

**20:18** · repo linked in the description. But,

**20:20** · after a little bit, the orchestrator

**20:21** · will decide, "Here's how I'm going to

**20:23** · create that first wave." And then, we'll

**20:25** · see the workers dispatched. So, there we

**20:27** · go. The orchestrator spent 6,000 tokens

**20:30** · with that initial planning and then

**20:32** · prompting our first three workers in

**20:34** · round number one. And so, we don't have

**20:36** · to watch paint dry seeing this go to

**20:38** · completion here, but you get the idea.

**20:40** · We saw the full run in the logs earlier

**20:42** · of how it'll go round by round doing

**20:44** · validation each time, and we can even

**20:46** · have human in the loop so that we get to

**20:48** · actually take a look at what has

**20:49** · happened in the first round before the

**20:52** · orchestrator moves on to the next. That

**20:54** · is the kind of reliability that I feel

**20:56** · like we really need to have right now in

**20:58** · order to build anything more than simple

**21:00** · demos with this kind of loop engineering

**21:02** · setup. And so, yeah, I I would encourage

**21:05** · you to just play around with this kind

**21:06** · of idea. Like building a a dashboard to

**21:08** · manage more autonomous tasks in

**21:10** · something like your second brain is a

**21:11** · big thing that I'm focusing on right

**21:13** · now. And we can even take this kind of

**21:15** · dashboard and deploy it to the cloud as

**21:17** · well, so we can access it from anywhere.

**21:19** · Maybe even start to share our loop setup

**21:22** · with our teammates. And these days it's

**21:24** · just so easy to take applications that

**21:26** · you build locally for these kinds of

**21:28** · control systems and deploy them to

**21:30** · production, so you can use it remotely

**21:31** · or have a team use it. Retool is a tool

**21:34** · specifically I've been leaning on a lot

**21:36** · for these kinds of deployments. And so

**21:38** · it's just so easy to create an app here,

**21:40** · and then we can import React code. So I

**21:42** · just had Claude code build the entire

**21:44** · dashboard in React with the idea of I'm

**21:47** · going to deploy this here. It's so

**21:49** · incredibly easy. So I just go in and I

**21:51** · take the zip file of the front end that

**21:53** · I just showed you, and then its agent is

**21:55** · going to go through wiring everything

**21:56** · up. So it'll connect to the back end

**21:58** · with the API that I have running with

**22:00** · Pi. It'll get everything deployed to a

**22:02** · real URL that I can use. It's really

**22:04** · neat. So for example, here connecting to

**22:05** · my Neon database where I'm storing all

**22:07** · of the runs for durability, it asks me

**22:10** · to set up a connection here. So I can

**22:12** · create a new resource. I can select

**22:14** · Postgres cuz that's what Neon is running

**22:16** · under the hood, and then set up all of

**22:18** · my connection information here. So

**22:20** · really easy to make that connection. So

**22:22** · I'm just deploying the front end here

**22:23** · and then connecting it to wherever I'm

**22:24** · hosting my app hosting Pi running behind

**22:27** · the scenes. So I'll get all this hooked

**22:29** · up off camera and then I'll show you the

**22:31** · final result here. And there we go.

**22:32** · Everything is deployed. We can see our

**22:35** · app hosted in the cloud just like it was

**22:37** · running locally. Very cool. So now we

**22:40** · have a URL where we can share this.

**22:41** · There's also a lot of other cool things

**22:43** · you can do in Retool. Like you can set

**22:44** · up permission groups, and so certain

**22:46** · actions that you can gate with an API

**22:47** · endpoint, so you have to approve it and

**22:49** · have the right permissions to do so. So

**22:51** · for example, being able to pause the

**22:54** · workflow and then resume it. If I click

**22:56** · this right here, you can see that

**22:57** · approve and resume, and you can see the

**22:59** · identity that I I through Retool. It's

**23:01** · giving me permission to actually do

**23:03** · that. And then it's also very easy to

**23:04** · edit this application. I can continue to

**23:06** · make changes with it here in the cloud

**23:08** · as I need, adding new features to the

**23:11** · front end, whatever I need as I'm

**23:12** · evolving my dashboard. So yeah, I've

**23:14** · just been doing a lot of this with like

**23:15** · deploying dashboards for observability

**23:17** · and helping with all my systems for my

**23:18** · second brain and my AI coding. Very

**23:21** · powerful stuff. And a quick shoutout to

**23:22** · the Retool team. Ever since I've been

**23:24** · using their platform, I've been working

**23:26** · with them and I even collabed to bring

**23:27** · this integration in the video today.

**23:30** · It's a great platform because you get to

**23:31** · build your applications directly in

**23:34** · Retool or you can import it like I

**23:35** · showed earlier. But then your team,

**23:37** · regardless, has a single governed path

**23:39** · to production with audit trails. Really

**23:42** · easy to make your changes just with chat

**23:43** · like I showed here and the review system

**23:45** · with human in the loop. All of it that

**23:48** · you need to ship your apps to

**23:49** · production. And I'll have a link in the

**23:51** · description. If you go now, you get free

**23:53** · app imports through July 1st and bonus

**23:55** · AI credits on all paid plans. So that's

**23:57** · everything I have to cover for loop

**23:59** · engineering. The basics, the problems

**24:01** · with it, how I'm solving for it because

**24:02** · I I really do want to incorporate loop

**24:04** · engineering. Like I like the concept of

**24:07** · it and I want to drive how autonomous my

**24:09** · coding agents can be, but you got to

**24:11** · have the right system. Otherwise, things

**24:13** · are going to completely fall apart like

**24:14** · we've already talked about. And so I

**24:16** · hope I've inspired some ideas for you,

**24:18** · even like how to use Arcan or start to

**24:20** · build this sort of harness for yourself.

**24:22** · Really, I would just fold loop

**24:24** · engineering into harness engineering. It

**24:25** · doesn't quite deserve its own buzzword,

**24:28** · right? But like there are some good

**24:29** · ideas here. And so I hope you found this

**24:31** · useful. If you did, I would really

**24:33** · appreciate a like and a subscribe. And

**24:35** · with that, I will see you in the next

**24:37** · video.
